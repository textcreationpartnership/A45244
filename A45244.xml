         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You beloved are of God, and have your fathers name written in your foreheads; you are the true <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> to whom pertaineth the <hi>Adoption,</hi> and the <hi>glory,</hi> the <hi>Covenants</hi> and Goſpel <hi>promiſes,</hi> whoſe are the fathers, and for whom Chriſt came, who is over all God bleſſed for ever. You are a choſen <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a Royal prieſthood, a holy nation, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, walking in the ſteps of your father Abraham,</hi> hearkning to that great <hi>Prophet</hi> whom God hath raiſed up among your brethren, and have been <hi>baptized into the name of the father, ſon, and holy ſpirit.</hi> But the <hi>devil</hi> (that implacable enemy of ſouls) hath endeavoured to wreak his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice upon you above all people, opening his floodgates to overwhelm you; the <hi>Archers</hi> have ſhot ſorely at you, the <hi>plowers</hi> have made deep furrows upon your backs, yet you are ſtill ſupported by the <hi>rock</hi> of Ages, and ſtrengthned by an Everlaſting <hi>Arm;</hi> they have
<pb facs="tcp:108740:3"/>
laboured in vain, for the bleſſings of your father <hi>Abraham</hi> have prevailed above the bleſſings of your progenitors.</p>
                  <p>Your begining in theſe nations (of late years) was but ſmall; yet when it pleaſed the Lord to diſpel thoſe clouds that overſhaddowed us, and ſcatter ſome beams of the Goſpel amongſt us, he gave you ſo great an increaſe that <hi>Sion</hi> may ſay with admiration, <hi>who hath begotten me theſe!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it leſſe obſervable that whereas other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations have been carryed on by the <hi>ſecular arm,</hi> and the Countenance and allowance of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, as in <hi>Luthers</hi> time by ſeveral <hi>German</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Reformation in <hi>England</hi> by King <hi>Edward, Q. Elizabeth,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> reformation, by a <hi>Parliament, Comittee of Eſtates, Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> beſides the favour and aſſiſtance of great perſonages; you have had none of theſe to take you by the hand, but your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe was againſt the impetuous current of humane oppoſition, attended with ſuch external diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as beſpeak your embracing this deſpiſed truth, an effect of heart-ſincerity, void of all mercenary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. Yea how active has the <hi>Accuſer</hi> of the Brethren been to repreſent you in ſuch frightful fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, expoſing you by that miſchievous artifice to popular <hi>Odium,</hi> and the laſh of Magiſtracy; in ſo much that the name of an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> was crime enough: which doubtleſſe was a heavy <hi>obſtacle</hi> in the way of many pious ſouls.</p>
                  <p>And what our diſſenting brethren have to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, upon that account (who inſtead of taking up, have laid <hi>ſtumbling blocks</hi> in the way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation)

will appear another day. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſtrenuous oppoſitions of thoſe great and learned ones, The mighty God of <hi>Jacob</hi> hath taken you by the hand, and ſaid <hi>be ſtrong.</hi>

                  <p>Beſides it has a conſiderable tendency to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of divine grace, if we conſider the way and manner of the Reviving this coſtly truth. When the profeſſors of theſe Nations had been a long time wearied with the yoke of <hi>ſuperſtitious ceremonies, traditions of men, and corrupt mixtures in the worſhip and ſervice of God;</hi> it pleaſed the Lord to break theſe yokes, and by a very ſtrong impulſe of his ſpirit upon the hearts of his people, to convince them of the neceſſity of Reformation.

And though it was purpoſed to be laid aſide, yet what fears, tremblings, and temptations did attend them leſt they ſhould be mistaken, conſidering how many learned and Godly men were of an oppoſite perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: How gladly would they have had the reſt of their brethren gone along with them? But when there was no hopes, they concluded that <hi>a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb facs="tcp:108740:4"/>
faith muſt not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, and that every one muſt give an account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God,</hi> and ſo reſolved to practiſe according to their light: The great objection was, the want of an <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> which (as I have heard) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by ſending certain meſsengers to <hi>Holland</hi> whence they were ſupplyed. So that this little cloud of Witneſſes, hath the Lord by his grace ſo greatly encreaſed, that it is ſpread over our Horizon, though oppoſed and contradicted by men of all ſorts.</p>
                  <p>And now friends I can ſafely bear you record, that it is not <hi>humour, conceitedneſſe</hi> or <hi>ſingularity</hi> (ſo often charged upon you) that makes you decline the BaptiZing your little ones: For I know they are as dear to you, as children are to any parents under heaven; your ſighs and tears, thoſe heart-breaking deſires and pathetick wiſhes you ſend to the mercy-ſeat for them, is a ſufficient teſtimony hereof, and your petitions, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> may live before God, that your children may be converted, that they may have an Intereſt in the new Covenant, that the law of God may be written in their hearts, that their ſins may be pardoned, their natures ſanctifyed, and their ſouls eternally ſaved And did you know that Baptiſm could contribute the leaſt <hi>iota</hi> hereunto, how readily and zealouſly would you perform it? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is an eaſy ſervice, that would bring you into the credit and eſteem of differing profeſſors, divers of your natural relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea 'tis as ſafe, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, nothing of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> or the <hi>Croſs</hi> attending it. And it is very remarkable that many have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for owning moſt (if not all other) points of faith and Chriſtianity, yea divers have ſuffered e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb facs="tcp:108740:4"/>
unto death for denying, yet none (that ever I heard of) ſuffered for owning Infants-Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Yet though your children are dear to you, the word of the Lord, and the purity of his worſhip is far more dear, and hence you dare not adde to his words leſt he reprove you, and you be found lyars. You dare not offer <hi>ſtrange fire</hi> to the Lord, which he hath not commanded, nor prophane an Ordinance; you know that Baptiſm (being a part of inſtituted worſhip, not found in natures garden) has of it ſelf no vertue, but what it receives from the iuſtitutor; For as one well obſerves <hi>moral laws are good, and therefore commanded: but poſitive worſhip is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and therefore good.</hi> So that your adverſaries clamour without ground, and the Lord will judge between us. And if it be queſtioned why I inſiſt ſo much upon this ſubject? I anſwer, I was weary with forbearing when I ſaw your affliction, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the reproaches, wherewith your opponents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully perſecute you. But brethren as I have gone in and out among you theſe ſix and twenty years, ſo I have had opportunity to know thoſe pious ſouls among you, <hi>whoſe Converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> who live above the Clouds, who groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>body of ſin, and remains of corruption,</hi> I have known your manner of life, your <hi>faith, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, long-ſuffering, charity;</hi> I have alſo ſeen your dark ſide, and obſerv'd your infirmities (which your adverſaries view through a multiplying glaſs;) But if there be any ſociety or Community of people that differ from you, that have not their dark ſide, <hi>let them caſt the firſt ſtone.</hi> Yet you dare not allow the leaſt ſin in you; your prayers and endeavours f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>IT is a truth too plain to need Demonſtration, that the enemy of ſouls invaded the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> even in its very infancy, <hi>privily bringing in Damnable Hereſies,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. That the <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let whore drew away the Kings of the Earth, peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations, and tongues after her,</hi> Rev. 17. <hi>and made them drunk with the wine of her Fornications.</hi> That the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> that <hi>ſon of perdition,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. erected himſelf a Monarchy, and <hi>ſate in the Temple of God,</hi> maintaining that ſtation with <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>ſignes,</hi> and <hi>lying wonders.</hi> So ſpreading and epidemical were the Incantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Glittering ſtrumpet, that few eſcaped the temptations of her <hi>Golden cup.</hi> Now amongſt thoſe multitudes that wondred after the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> what kind entertainment could the ordinances of the meek and ſelf denying Jeſus have? <hi>whoſe kingdom is not of this world, John.</hi> 18.36. On the contrary, we find the whole Fabrick, and Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of Goſpel worſhip ſhatter'd, ſubverted, and overthrown in moſt places where it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and the kingdom of darkneſs raiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its ruines. What fundamental truth, what practical duty of Chriſtianity but was utterly exploded, or ſo metamorphos'd, that nothing of its original form and beauty was left? But when this <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> came to be gradually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; when the voice from heaven ſaid, <hi>come out of her my people,</hi> Rev. 18.4. <hi>when the woman was
<pb facs="tcp:108740:6"/>
ſeen drunk with the bloud of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 17.6. How was ſhe bewailed by thoſe that dealt in her wares! How have thoſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> of the bottomleſs pit peſter'd both ſea and land to gain her <hi>proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites!</hi> making Reformation a hard task, purſuing it with bloud, perſecution, and maſſacre. Yet, maugre all the powers of Hell, truth gets ground, and the Lord with the brightneſſe of his coming, enlightens us more and more every day.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſtill it is very obſervable, that when [by quadrating them with the word of God, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule of faith and practiſe] any truths are reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; or when thoſe carnal and traſhy ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls that deform and diſguiſe others, are flung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; Then ſome malevolent Agent of the grand Deceiver, improves his uttermoſt craft to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and repreſent it in the moſt hideous and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting forms, and faſten the blackeſt calumnies upon ſuch as the Lord makes his Inſtruments of reformation. The ſon of God foretold this, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.11. All ages ſince have confirmed it. Our Martyrologies have recorded thoſe worthies that <hi>reſiſted unto blood, thoſe bleſſed ſouls under the Altar, that were ſlain for the word of God, and the Teſtimony which they held, to whom the white robes were given,</hi> Rev. 6.9, 11. whoſe blood will one day be avenged upon their Barbarous Aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinates.</p>
                  <p>The ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> [that great and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical duty here contended for] hath been as groſly perverted, mangled, and abuſed as any Goſpel Inſtitution whatever, new matter, new form, nothing left but the bare name, and that
<pb facs="tcp:108740:6"/>
too wreſted, miſinterpreted, and forced to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and bear ſymmetry with that Idle and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous <hi>Poedo-rantiſm</hi> ſet up in its room.</p>
                  <p>Nor need we wonder at the ſtiff oppoſition and harſh uſage the aſſertors of <hi>Believers Baptiſm</hi> have met with from time to time; the error they attaque being ſo neceſſary to the <hi>Antichriſtian Monarchy,</hi> that it is indeed the <hi>Baſis</hi> upon which that pompous, proud ſuperſtructure moves, from whoſe Pinacle, the man of ſin may caſt an Imperious glance and ſay with <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vah Babylon, Babylon proprio te robore ſervo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, if a thorough reformation of this point be admitted; if Miniſters <hi>teach firſt, then baptize ſuch only as profeſs faith in the Lord Jeſus, and newneſs of life evidenced by a holy converſation,</hi> (that being the only practiſe warrantable by, and exemplyfied in the word of God) It will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably follow, that the Papal Monarchy (that great thing <hi>Catechreſtically</hi> call'd a Church) muſt vaniſh, and the large Revenues, pomp, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of its active Janizaries expire with it: ſince the matter of ſuch a ſynagogue is the collective body of the nations; which becauſe of its unbelief and prophaneſſe the word of God excludes out of the Church, till in Gods time and by his power gradually converted: it being evident from the mouth that errs not, that the greateſt part of Mankind traverſes the broad way to deſtruction, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.13.</p>
                  <p>Surely this one conſideration has a more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rhetorick to keep up this pernicious practiſe, then all the juglings of its abettors, or the gaudy
<pb facs="tcp:108740:7"/>
flouriſhes or ſpecious <hi>Fulcrums</hi> its defenders pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to illuſtrate and ſupport it. It is one of the Popes political (and very neceſſary) maximes, [and I fear borrowed by many from him,] wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that power by which the Goſpel miniſters acted, to principle the emiſſaries that manage his cauſe very ripely in ſchool-ſophiſtry, and ſuch other ſubtile qualifications, that their learned craft, and ſeeming profoundneſs of wiſdom and parts may amuſe and captivate the generality of mankind. And indeed we find them too apt to be gaping after thoſe ornaments, which the Apoſtle elegantly calls, <gap reason="foreign">

They are well verſed in the perplexing Idle whimſies of <hi>Ariſtotle, Scotus</hi> &amp;c. but meer dunces and fools in plain Scripture doctrines: their Heathen Philoſophy and the Goſpel being at as wide a diſtance, as the Earth is from the third Heaven. <hi>See Job.</hi> 5.12.13. <hi>and</hi> 32.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19.</p>
                  <p>But what is moſt lamentable is, that miniſters that are ſeparatiſts from national corruption and prophaneſs, and (in the judgment of charity) in many things orthodox and pious, ſhould be the forwardeſt oppoſers of ſo neceſſary a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and not only ſo, but when they find the pretences upon which it was (with a ridiculous retinue) obtruded upon the world rotten and reeling, they muſt invent new ſupporters for it, viz. <hi>a Covenant right derivative from a believing parent &amp;c.</hi> As if ſpiritual graces would admit of carnal propagations, or that a Chriſtian doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb facs="tcp:108740:7"/>

                  <p>In the judgment of ſome it may parhaps add to the credit of that fancy that ſo famous a man as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is, ſhould patronize it. But he is not the firſt <hi>Theological grandee</hi> that has been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. Performances of never ſo exalted a kind conferr not the priviledge of Infallible. 'Tis only the great Creator is unerring. A man may preach and write of the moſt ſeraphick verities, and yet know but in part; Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> is to be honoured as far as he has laid himſelf out to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and improve his Talent for the Converſion of ſouls in this evil day; But when he forgets himſelf, and inſtead of promoting practical holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fills the nation with notions as uncertain as they are numberleſs, puzling ſuch as arrive not to the ſubtilty of his diſtinction, creating more doubts then ever he'l be able to reſolve, making Chriſtianity a meer riddle which no man underſtands but he, and liable to as many forms and interpretations as his wavering mind: Then I humbly conceive he may be very ſafely left. <gap reason="foreign">

But being ſo ſucceſſeſſe in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> he may very well deſpair of that undertaking.

                  <p>His next project is, to take <hi>Col. Danvers</hi> to task; he thinks it beneath a man of his Talent to let him paſſe without fixing an Epithete upon

                  <p>But, candid Reader, here thou haſt them coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of that fort Royal they fancy ſo ſecure, <hi>viZ their modern pretences to a Covenant heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry title</hi> to Baptiſm: The ſubſtance of what they can ſay in their own defence is examined and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly refuted: The vanity of their ſilly diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons detected, and the Doctrine of the Covenant cleared, and made familiar to the conſcientious peruſer. And ſo the Lord (who will infallibly reckon with Mr <hi>B.</hi> and his confederate, unleſſe they repent, for putting ſuch blocks and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's in the way to his truth) ſet it home upon thy heart, and give thee a diſcerning ſpirit, to own him according to his directions in his word, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Ambuſhes and attaques of Satan, and his Engines, in deſpight of whom <hi>truth always ſtood, ſince the Nativity of time, and ſhall ſurvive its utmoſt period and obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let it not defer thee from a ſerious weighing of the Arguments here offered, that ſome of them may be heretofore preſented; that dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes not their force: <hi>Nil dictum eſt quod
<pb facs="tcp:108740:11"/>
non eſt dictum prius.</hi> Yet this wrangler Mr <hi>W.</hi> would put us to the trouble of quoting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans name that has the ſame ſence or like words with us, to avoid his aſperſion of plagiaries: A provident ſhift he has got to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the edge of any Argument that gravells him. May not men often hit upon the ſame thing, from neceſſity of the Argument, or chance, not choice or deſigne? I am certain no man's more guilty in that particular then this Mr of Arts.</p>
                  <p>But there's need enough of preſſing the ſame things again and again. When they produce new grounds for their practice (but I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this from the Covenant is the laſt ſhift) we'l addreſſe New Arguments to confront them; for the current of the Scripture will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us variety of <hi>Mediums</hi> to quaſh their bold encroachments.</p>
                  <p>The ſubject of the Covenant (their cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Sanctuary) hath not hitherto been ſo ſingly inſiſted upon as 'tis here; although it has been cleared ſufficiently (one would think to candid Readers) <hi>by Mr Blackwood, Tombs, Laurence, Danvers,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe acurate and learned works are enough to ſatisfy every one that would be found in the ſerious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall inveſtigation of truth: And indeed leave ſuch a reader without excuſe.</p>
                  <p>This Treatiſe is chiefly calculated for the peruſal of ſome ſober friends that importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Author to write ſomething upon this
<pb facs="tcp:108740:12"/>
ſubject. And if truth hath any advancement by it, he hath his end. He is careleſſe of popular applauſe or cenſure. He hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed his Mite for common information, and undeceiving the many ſouls that ſtill hold faſt thoſe Dreggs and Remains of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THou muſt know I do not write this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think there are not Books enough extant upon this <hi>ſubject:</hi> But becauſe I obſerve that old books (though never ſo excellent) are laid by, and ſeldom looked into, and nothing's reliſhable with this curious <hi>Age</hi> but what's contemporary with it ſelf: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many of the books already written are ſo large that ordinary perſons cannot attain to the price; and ſome ſo intricate, and deliver'd in ſuch a ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of phraſe, that they are beyond the capacity of divers godly and well meaning Chriſtians. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ſent out this without the exteriour var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh of humane blandiſhments, that I may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this truth to every mans conſcience. Eloquence is nothing but Air, faſhioned with an Articulate and diſtinct ſound, and when ſuited to entice and enveigle carnall affections, may do much; but there is a peculiar Majeſty and veneration, upon the brow of truth that will not be beholden to thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial braveryes: No ornaments render it more illuſtrious then its own native plaineſſe. The end of ſpeech is to make our conceptions intelligible; and when our meaning is carried away by towring ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions paſt the reach of a plain Reader, what is it but a gay piece of vanity, and affected pedantry?</p>
                  <p>I know the difference between the partyes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in this <hi>Dialogue,</hi> diſtracts the minds and troubles the hearts of many that are Godly. Now in this diſtraction every ſerious man cannot chooſe but
<pb facs="tcp:108740:14"/>
heartily deſire and wiſh for <hi>reſolution.</hi> And in order to obtain that, the moſt likely way, is to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the pretenſions and grounds on both hands. In proſecution of which I have ſelected the moſt plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument inſiſted upon by the <hi>Poedobaptiſts</hi> of this age (nay the only grand pretence upon which that baffled practiſe is ſupported) ſo that I may ſay, that all the Auxiliary conſiderations that contribute to its reinforcement, will fall in the fate, and live and dy with this <hi>Cardinal Theſis</hi> (drawn from the Covenant) in its favour.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it may be ſaid, that I make the <hi>Poedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> ſpeak what I pleaſe, not what they think, this muſt be ſaid of courſe, elſe they loſe their old wont. Nor ſhall I think it ſtrange, if inſtead of ſolid Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers they return their uſual Oratory of calumny, and treat me with that ſeverity ſo liberally diſpenc'd to their oppoſites [eſpecially by thoſe writers who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the liſts for this cauſe of late years] for their cauſe requires it. To ſilence all clamors will be a task of impoſſibility, and I ſhall ſuperſede any thoughts of the attempt, but for ſatisfaction to the tender-hearted and gratious Chriſtian, I ſay further that I have endeavoured to cull out the ſtrongeſt enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I could finde, and have declined nothing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I met within their beſt Authors; if they think otherwiſe, let them produce their greateſt ſtrength, and lay it down in plain propoſitions (without that incumbrance and perplexity of words and wheeling phraſes, as involve their meanings in puzling am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities) and I hope they will finde it fairly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>The Argumentative part which I put into their
<pb facs="tcp:108740:14"/>
Mouths, is ſuch as was firſt taken from thence, and it is but a piece of Juſtice and reſtitution to return them thither. They are ſuch as are famouſly known to be their principles, ſtill the ſence, often the very words of their moſt celebrated Authors.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon that I take no more notice of Mr <hi>Will's</hi> book is becauſe Mr <hi>D.</hi> who hath already wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyly defended the Hiſtorical part, hath promiſed alſo to reckon with him as to the ſcriptural part, and I would not anticipate him, whoſe works will praiſe him in the gate, notwithſtanding the diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous cavils and querulous janglings that fill up Mr <hi>Wills's</hi> invective Pampblet.</p>
                  <p>I hope our Oppoſites will not diſallow the liberty they themſelves take, of making uſe of ſome pious and learned men, that have trod the paths of this controverſy before us of late years. I could wiſh that the voluminous and accurate Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of M. <hi>Tombs</hi> were epitomiZed for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ordinary well meaning Chriſtian, the Arguments of the <hi>Poedobaptiſts</hi> being there lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly and ſolidly confuted, and perhaps to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of many of the learned ones, who (had not reputation interpoſed, having born a ſignal teſtimony to ſome excellent truths, which they fear might be called in queſtion had they ſubſcribed a Recantation of this) would poſſibly own as much</p>
                  <p>It is not arrived to the degree of Miracle that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven good men are loath to own themſelves tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and deſtroy the things they built. <hi>Pezelius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that when one from <hi>Frankford</hi> brought <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi> inſtitutions to <hi>Luther,</hi> demanding his opinion of it; he replyes <hi>profecto non inepte hic Author
<pb facs="tcp:108740:15"/>
dixit,</hi> indeed this Author hath not ſaid fooliſhly, meaning that he had ſpoke right, yet recanted not his (oppoſite) Doctrine, but privately communicates his miſtake to <hi>Melancthon,</hi> fearing that a publique conviction might diſcredit all his Doctrine. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Reader I offer my conceptions of this bandied point to thy candid acceptation, and with this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that nothing but a zeal for Goſpel reformation ſhould invite me to expoſe my ſentiments to this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious age, and if they contribute ought to that end, I have my aim, And ſo I commend thee to the good ſpirit of truth, to lead thee into all truth, and remain</p>

                     <p>Yea, I have been at divers, but their Logical way of diſcourſe does ſo obſcure and hide the truth, that when the Diſpute is done, we are no wiſer then before; now Sir, is there no way to finde out truth but by Logick?</p>

                     <p>My Friend, you muſt know, that there is a natural Logick, which all men have, except fools and Idiots, and it is nothing elſe but reaſon methodized: but as for School-Logick which men make a great flouriſh with, eſpecially amongſt women and illiterate perſons, though by it alſo truth may be diſcovered, if men were ingenuous, and deſired truth more then victory: but alas! it is miſerably abuſed by men of corrupt minds, to the deceiving of the hearts of the ſimple; but ſeeing you have mentioned it, I ſhall give you the opinion of a Learned man about it: <hi>Nothing</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath ſpoyled truth, more then the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Logick, it hath found out ſo many diſtinctions, that it inwraps reaſon in a miſt of doubts, tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon drawn into too fine a thred, tying up truth in a twiſt of words; which being hard to unlooſe carry her away as a priſoner; 'tis a net to entangle her, or an art inſtructing you, how to tell a reaſonable lie: like an overcurious workman, it hath ſought to make truth ſo excellent, that it hath marred it.</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves <hi>ſaith, he doubts not, the devil did invent it, It hath layd on ſo many Colours that the Counterfeit is more various then the pattern. It gives us ſo many likes, that we know not which is the ſame; nature it ſelf makes every man a Logician; they that brought in the art have preſented us with one that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted her;</hi> But I ſpeak this of Logick at large,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108740:16"/>
there may be an excellency found in the art, and it is good to retayn it, that we may make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us againſt it ſelf, in matters of Religion, we muſt make faith the means to aſcertain, for other matters ſimple nature is the beſt reaſon, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked reaſon the beſt Logick.</p>

                     <p>Sir I thank you for your opinion about <hi>Logick,</hi> and I think it were better, if our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters did leſs uſe it and diſpute after the ſame manner as they preach; which is, to lay down a propoſition, and to prove it by Scripture, and reaſon; it would better ſatisfy the people; but we have gone a little out of our way, my great deſire is to diſcourſe with you about <hi>Infants-Baptiſm:</hi> and eſpecially concerning the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed; which if you can remove, I reſolve to be of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

                     <p>Its true, the Covenant or promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, is the great hinge or Engine upon which the whole buſineſs of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptiſm</hi> moves; now if I prove that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believing Gentiles are not the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then Infant Church-member-ſhip, under the Goſpel, and Baptiſm falls to the ground.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Poed.</speaker>
                     <p>True Sir, and therefore pray let me hear your arguments.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bap.</speaker>
                     <p>Firſt then, I argue thus. If none be the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but thoſe that do the works of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Then infants are not the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Antecedent is true, <hi>John</hi> 8.39. <hi>If ye
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108740:17"/>
were the Children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>ye would do the works of Abraham.</hi> So therefore is the conſequent.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Poed.</speaker>
                     <p>But our Miniſters tells us this is meant of the adult; and not of Infants.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bap.</speaker>
                     <p>I know they do ſo, and they think they had better ſay ſomething, then nothing, but I proceed.</p>
                     <p>The Second Argument.</p>
                     <p>If thoſe that are <hi>Chriſts, are only</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed;</hi> then Infants are not <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed.</p>
                     <p>The Antecedent in true <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3.19. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the conſequent.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſay, Infants are Chriſts, I anſwer, ſome are ſo by Election, but the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch as are Chriſts by calling, not Election: which is ſecret to us.</p>
                     <p>But 3dly. If none are bleſſed with <hi>Abraham</hi> but thoſe that are of faith, then infants are not the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Antecedent is true, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. <hi>ſo then they that are of faith, are bleſſed with faithfull</hi> Abraham.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo</hi> the Conſequent is true alſo.</p>
                     <p n="4">4thly. If the Children of the fleſh are not the Children of God, then infants are not now the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Antecedent is true. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. <hi>they which are the children of fleſh, theſe are not the children of God,</hi> But the children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed: <hi>Ergo</hi> ſo is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, I ſay, the children of the fleſh may be the children of God by Election, but they are not ſo by calling, and ſo not counted for the ſeed; and if you ſtill urge, as I know you will, that all theſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108740:17"/>
places are meant of the Adult only, then let us read the words as you would have us, and ſee what abſurdity you will father upon the holy ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. <hi>They that are of faith, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham:</hi> and they alſo that are not of faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>They that are Chriſts (viz.</hi> viſibly) <hi>are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed,</hi> and they that are not Chriſts, are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. <hi>They which are the children of the fleſh are not the children of God.</hi> (vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly); and they that are the children of fleſh are the children of God viſibly.</p>
                     <p>So from <hi>John</hi> 8.39. <hi>They that do the works of</hi> Abraham <hi>are the children of God; and they that do not the works of</hi> Abraham <hi>are the children of God;</hi> ſo we muſt read the words, if theſe texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be not excluſive.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Poed.</speaker>
                     <p>It is very true, if thoſe texts be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, we muſt read the words, or at leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, as you have, ſaid; but then we ſhould make the Scripture guilty of great abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and contradiction.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Poed.</speaker>
                     <p>But out miniſters tells us, <hi>the promiſe is to you and your children, and them that are afar off:</hi> by which they underſtand believing Gentiles and their ſeed.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bap</speaker>
                     <p>But what do you mean by promiſe? is it the promiſe and covenant of eternal life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? or the promiſe of outward ordinances? If you ſay the firſt; then we ask you whether that promiſe be abſolute or conditional? If abſolute,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108740:18"/>
then all the children of believers muſt needs be ſaved. If you ſay conditional, and faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, be the condition, then we are agreed: and the controverſy is ended.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Poed.</speaker>
                     <p>No, we do not ſay that by promiſe in the 2d of the <hi>Acts,</hi> is meant the promiſe of eternal life and ſalvation, for that is not made, much leſs made good to any, upon the tearms of their parents faith; but upon their own perſonal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and obedience, but we mean the promiſe of outward ordinances, as to be baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Bap.</speaker>
                     <p>Very well; if that be <hi>Peters</hi> meaning, that believers infants ſhall be admitted to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinances, when others ſhall not: Then conſider what a poor promiſe this is, and what a miſerable comforter he is made by you, in making as if this were all his meaning, and all that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by this pretious word of promiſe. But you muſt know <hi>Peters</hi> buſineſs was to ſupport the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſmitten down under a ſence of ſin and the guilt of <hi>Chriſts</hi> blood, which lay heavy upon them but if this be all he intended you, and your children ſhall be baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the plaiſter is not broad enough for the ſoar; for, pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and we will ſuppoſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking thus to them: you have by wicked hands crucified the Lord of life, and wiſhed his blood to be upon you and your children, but be of good comfort, believe and be baptized, and then you and your children ſhall ſtand under the title of the people of God, under right to outward ordinances, when others ſhall not, and not only you, but your children ſhall be baptiſed. But neither you nor
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108740:18"/>
they ever the ſooner ſaved, as born of you, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then together with you they ſhall believe and obey the Goſpel; in which caſe of faith and obedience, all unbelievers in the world and their children, ſhall be ſaved as ſoon as either you or they. It is as much as to ſay, the promiſe of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to partake of the ordinances, is to you, and your ſeed above other; but the promiſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance is as much to all others and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as to you and yours. What moſt comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs comfort is this, to men caſt down under a ſence of ſin and guilt? what a pittiful plaiſter is here applied to men prick'd at the heart, and ſmarting under the direful apprehenſion of Gods wrath? beſides what exquiſite nonſence do you make the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeak, if his words be taken in your ſence, for they muſt run thus, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt by way of precept, repent and be baptized you and your children. 2ly, by way of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo the priviledge of being baptized ſhall belong to you and your children which unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and their ſeed ſhall not enjoy. But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation, is made no more to you then to them; But without doubt it muſt be otherwiſe: the promiſe, take it which way you will, either for the proffer of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or the thing promiſed, It muſt needs be of ſome more excellent matter than outward mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, &amp; ordinances, abſtract from remiſſion of ſins and ſalvation: yea, 'tis moſt evident that the thing here promiſed is no leſs then remiſſion of ſins and ſalvation it ſelf, for as no leſs is expreſſed in the very text <hi>remiſſion of ſins, and the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:108740:19"/>
which, elſewhere is called the <hi>earneſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> So, unleſs you will divide the children from having a ſhare alike with their parents in that promiſe, which in the ſelf ſame ſentence, term and ſence, is promiſed alike to them both, ſo as to ſay, the word promiſe, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the parents; but of an inferiour thing, <hi>viZ.</hi> a right to ordinances only, as in relation to the Infants only, which were great abſurdity to utter, it muſt neceſſarily be meant of one kinde of mercy, to both parents and children: yea and upon the ſame termes too, and no other then thoſe upon which its tendred to the parents, <hi>viz.</hi> perſonal repentance, and obedience, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of remiſſion and ſalvation, and not of ſuch a trivial title to external participation only as you talk of, which if it be, then, unleſs you aſſert that God hath promiſed ſalvation abſolutly to all the natural ſeed of believers, upon thoſe terms only, as they are their ſeed, which you dare not ſtand too, the promiſe, mean which you will, the bare propoſal, or the ſalvation propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or both; upon thoſe terms, belongs of right, not only to believers and their poſterity, but alſo to all men, and their poſterity, without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, when at years of capacity to neglect, or perform them; for the glad tidings of ſalvation are commanded to be preached to all, and proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to every creature at years, to hear, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; though not to infants on terms of their parents faith; ſo aſſuredly the terms being performed, the ſalvation ſo promiſed ſhall be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108740:19"/>
enjoyed: there is no right by birth to ſalvation, or the promiſe of it in believers ſeed, more then in unbelievers; nor no priviledge to them more then to others, ſave the meer hopefulneſs of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and advantage of inſtruction in the way and means of ſalvation; which may poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall believers children, more then others: though in caſe it happen (as ſometime it doth) that the children of believers, have their breeding amongſt unbelievers, and the children of unbelievers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt believers, in that caſe theſe la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t have not only no leſs priviledge, as to the promiſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by bare birth, but a priviledge alſo by that breeding above the other.</p>
                     <p>That therefore, that the promiſe of the Goſpel covenant in any ſence in the world, is made to believers ſeed (as barely ſuch) more then to the natural ſeed of unbelievers, can never be proved by the word; yea the contrary is evident from this place <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.38.39.</p>
                     <p>For, firſt neither were theſe parents believers as yet, when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, the <hi>promiſe is to you, and your children;</hi> but only were <hi>pricked at the heart</hi> upon ſome meaſure of conviction; that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom they had crucified, was the Lord of life (which the <hi>devils believe &amp; tremble at</hi>) &amp; in order to begetting that ſaving faith, (which yet they had not) he ſpake theſe words of encouragement.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, doth <hi>Peter</hi> make the promiſe any otherwiſe to them and their children, then he doth to <hi>all others in the world,</hi> viz. on condition of their coming in at Gods call, 'tis ſayd <hi>to you and your children, and them that are afar off;</hi> all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108740:20"/>
of perſons in all nations, and generations, as the Lord our God ſhall call, <hi>viz.</hi> as are prevailed with to come when God calls them; which to be the ſence of this place, is further illuſtrated by that parallel place <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>they that are called, receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, when the parents did believe, &amp; were baptized; were any of their children baptized with them? which they muſt have been, had that promiſe been to the Infants, as well as to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents on that ſingle account of being their ſeed, but that no Infants were then baptized, appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture recording how many were baptized at that time, it concludes them under ſuch a term, as excludes the Infant from that days work, while it ſays, <hi>as many,</hi> meaning no more (or elſe we are deceived in the relation) <hi>as gladly received the word</hi> (this Infants could not do) <hi>were then baptiZed,</hi> which number, as they are recorded to be about 3000 might in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood have amounted to three times 3000. if all the Infants of thoſe had been baptized alſo; ſo that I conclude, if they had Infants why did they not bring them? or at leaſt ſend for them? here being ſo fit an opportunity, to baptize them; and ſo (for ever) to put the controverſy out of doubt.</p>
                     <p>But fourthly, neither were there any more enchurched that day, but ſuch as gladly received the word, and were thereupon baptized. For of theſe only (and not infants) its ſaid <hi>they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the Apoſtles doctrine, in Fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread and prayers.</hi> But all their Infants muſt have been Enchurch'd alſo, if they had been baptized.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:108740:20"/>Fifthly, it croſſeth the current of all other Scripture to put ſuch a conſtruction upon this, for that the promiſe of old, I mean the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the law, which was of the Earthly <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and but a Type of this, did pertain unto a fleſhly holy ſeed, I grant. But that the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Goſpel promiſe is made to any mans fleſhly ſeed, that thereupon we may baptize them in token of it, I deny. For ſure I am the Scripture holds out no other ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be heirs with him of the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but his ſpiritual ſeed, <hi>i. e.</hi> Believers that do his works. Nor doth it own any (but theſe) to have the right of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip and Fellowſhip in his family <hi>i. e.</hi> the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church. For if it ſhould be granted, that the viſible Church is <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, under the Goſpel, as well as under the law: yet it is ſo altered from what it was, ſo different in its conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that it is even turned upſide down, and in a manner nothing remains as then it was. For as the covenant is not the ſame, with that of the law, ſo neither is there the ſame Mediator, nor the ſame Prieſthood, nor the ſame Law, nor the ſame Law-giver, nor the ſame promiſes: That being of an <hi>Earthly,</hi> this of an <hi>heavenly</hi> inheritance, nor the ſame holy ſeed, to which the promiſes are made: that being to the Typical ſeed, <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, this to the true ſeed <hi>Chriſt</hi> and believers Nor the ſame ordinances, theirs being <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> and the <hi>Paſſe-over,</hi> ours <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> Nor the ſame <hi>ſubjects</hi> for thoſe ordinances, thoſe being (by nature) <hi>Jews</hi> or at leaſt by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and their Male ſeed only; ours Male and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108740:21"/>
female: theirs, whether believing or not, ours only as believing. So that whatever can be ſaid of the Covenant, the promiſe, the holy ſeed; is only this, they were Typical, ceremonial, abiding only to the time of Reformation <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9. and are now all abrogated, and out of date, ſo that we may ſay (as he) <hi>fuit Ilium,</hi> ſo <hi>fuit</hi> Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>fuit lex, fuit Templum, fuit ſacerdotium, fuit ſacroſanctum ſemen.</hi> There was indeed a holy land, a holy law, a holy Prieſthood, a holy ſeed, But all theſe belonging to a firſt Covenant which was faulty, are now long ſince vaniſhed before a better, and <hi>whatever was glorious hath now no glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by reaſon of a glory that excelleth.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9, 10, 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Poed.</hi> Sir, I thank you for your opinion of this text <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. But though the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles have no right to the Covenant by vertue of their Parents faith yet may they not have a right by vertue of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bap.</hi> In no wiſe; for the natural poſterity of believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are ſo far from being heires apparent with <hi>Abraham,</hi> of Goſpel promiſes and priviledges, that even <hi>Abrahams</hi> own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeed, (as ſuch only) are not at all his ſeed, at this day, nor at all holy with the birth-holyneſſe they once had, nor entail'd as heirs of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan,</hi> without faith and Repentance in their own perſons; and becauſe this is the very root and knot in the ſtate of this controverſy, the unfolding of which will diſcover the whole myſtery of your miſtakes, all which ariſe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from your erring in it, for <hi>error minimus in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108740:21"/>
principio, fit major in medio, maximus in fine.</hi> Give me leave therefore to enlarge a little upon this point.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then let it be conſidered, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> own ſeed, even thoſe that were heirs with him of the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> though born of his body now (as truly though more remotely) of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who was the greateſt believer in the world (Chriſt excepted) even theſe are not his ſeed in the Goſpel account, nor heirs of the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; nor (as born of his body) to be admitted to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and Church priviledges, which I make appear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6.7.8. in which pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how the Apoſtle denies <hi>Abrahams</hi> own Natural Children, the name of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, in the ſenſe of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he magnifies them exceedingly in the 4th. <hi>verſe,</hi> and ſets out their dignity and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above all people under the name of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, to whom pertained the Adoption, and the glory, and the Covenants,</hi> i. e. both Teſtaments, the Type, and the Anti-type, unto whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, not only the giving of the law, but alſo the promiſes, and that not only of the Earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but of the Goſpel Covenant in the firſt tender of it, not in reſpect of any right they had to it by birth (whether they received it or not) but as I ſaid in reſpect of the firſt tenders of it, which appears becauſe by ſpeciall order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment it was to be offered to them in the firſt place.</p>
                     <p>Nor was it carried to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> till the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſlighted it, in proof whereof the Scripture is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108740:22"/>
very plain <hi>Math.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. Chriſt forbids his Diſciples to go to any of the Gentiles, or to any ſave <hi>the loſt ſheep of the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> yea they were Children at this time, <hi>whoſe Bread,</hi> (till they loathed it) <hi>was not to be given to dogs except a few crums of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence the Jews were firſt bid to the wedding <hi>Math.</hi> 22.3. but they would not come. So they are called <hi>the Children of the kingdom Math.</hi> 8.12. that were to be caſt out becauſe they would not receive the Goſpel; for <hi>he came unto his own and his own received him not;</hi> yea <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Jews <hi>it was neceſſary the word of God ſhould firſt be ſpoken unto them, Act.</hi> 13.46.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all which glory and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of this people <hi>Iſrael</hi> who were the fathers alſo, and of whom (as concerning the fleſh) Chriſt came. <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had ſhewed their high priviledges, comes with Alas! and great ſorrow of heart, that he was forced to exclude them, (ſave a few with whom the Goſpel took effect) even from the name of <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and from ſtanding <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children any longer. For, ſaith he, (as who ſhould ſay, the more is the pitty) <hi>they are not all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that are of Iſrael,</hi> that is all that are <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, are not Goſpel Iſraelites, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed are no longer counted his ſeed, but they that are Chriſts by faith, are counted for the ſeed; and that this is the meaning of the words is evident from them that follow. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>neither becauſe they are the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all Children; but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> that is, theſe which

are the Childſen of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God, but the children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed.</p>
                     <p>A clear illuſtration we have of this <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7.9. where the Apoſtle urges this term, <hi>they which are of faith</hi> (that is, which believe) for none elſe are of faith, <hi>the ſame are the Children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and are bleſſed with faithfull</hi> Abraham. He ſaith not, they which be of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh, for ſuch are not accounted his Children as to the Goſpel Covenant, much leſſe doth he ſay or mean, that thoſe which are born of the body's of them that be of faith are <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, and ſo to be ſigned, as his ſons by Baptiſm, as his own fleſhly ſeed were ſigned by Circumciſion, as heirs with him of the old <hi>Canaan.</hi> As if becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> is the ſpiritual father of all that believe and walk in his ſteps, therefore he muſt be a father to all their natural poſterity too, and be the ſpiritual father not of their perſons only, but of their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring alſo.</p>
                     <p>But let me tell you he is not ſo much as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his own ſeed, in a Goſpel ſence, neither can theſe ſtand his children, nor the children of God, or heirs of the heavenly bleſſing and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom becauſe they come out of his loins, unleſs they do as he did. For though his fleſhly ſeed, as a type for the time then being, ſtood denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the children of God, and holy in an outward ſenſe, and heirs according to the earthly promiſe, yet that account is now gone, &amp; there is no other way whereby the Jews themſelves, much leſſe any generations amongſt the Gentils can be ſtil'd

the children of God, or of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo as to expect the Goſpel portion, but by believing in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> in their own perſons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>ye are all the Children of God by faith in Ieſus Chriſt; and if ye be Chriſts then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another Scripture that proves that <hi>Abrahams</hi> own ſeed, in the old Covenant account are not his ſeed, in the account of the Goſpel, ſo as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to have right to ordinances is, <hi>John</hi> 8.33. <hi>to the</hi> 40. where Chriſt being cavilled at by the Jews, for promiſing freedom from ſin, to which they were ſlaves and ſervants, notwithſtanding the legal freedom they ſo much boaſted of, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers plainly, the cutting off the Jews from three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the repute and denomination of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> children.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From any ſhare in the ſpiritual bleſſings of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From any further right to Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ordinances.</p>
                     <p>Firſt they alledge that they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed <hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>that they were not born of Fornication, ver.</hi> 39. (meaning as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was) but they <hi>had one father even God</hi> v. 41. To which Chriſt anſwers, not by denying of any of all this, for it was all true in that ſenſe in which they meant it, yea they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, and Chriſt confeſſes it ver. 37. <hi>I know you are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed,</hi> yea they were all the Children of God, by an outward and Typicall adoption of them unto himſelf. But Chriſt overthrows all, by telling them, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108740:23"/>
                        <hi>Abrahams</hi> children are accounted of otherwiſe now then formerly; not as coming out of his loyns, but doing his works, as being allyed to him, not ſo much after the fleſh as after the faith. Whereupon not yet believing he denies them to be now <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, in the true and ſubſtantiall ſenſe, and that appears in this <hi>Hypotheſis ver.</hi> 39. <hi>If ye were</hi> Abrahams <hi>children ye would do the works of Abraham.</hi> To which do but add the Minor; But ye do not the works of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And then the concluſion follows; Therefore ye are not the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> You ſee Chriſt aſſerts them to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the old account, ſo as to ſtand members of the old houſe, but denies them to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children in the ſenſe of the New.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. They ſay they are freemen, and were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in bondage: this Chriſt alſo grants: it was ſo indeed in the outward Typical ſenſe, they were freemen and heirs of that earthly glory that was promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in that <hi>old Canaan,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's them to be freemen as to the Goſpel, with heavenly freedom of that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, which is the mother of all believers <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.20. yea aſſerts that they were but ſervants, and in bondage to ſin, which is the greateſt ſlavery of all <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>he that commits ſin is the ſervant of ſin.</hi> So that for all their ſonſhips, in truth they were but ſervants. He grants their ſonſhip and title to the old inheritance, but denies it to the new.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly. They boaſt or bleſſe themſelves in their ſtanding in the houſe or family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is the viſible Church, as to the ordinances, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108740:24"/>
and rights whereof, who but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had the title. For this indeed was their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of old, that to them were committed the oracles of God To which Chriſt anſwers, true; they did ſtand in the houſe for a time, yet but for a time, and though ſons and heirs in the laws Typical ſenſe, yet they were but ſervants in the Goſpels. And being but ſervants, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his houſe, the old Church were; they muſt anon be turn'd out of the houſe, and abide in the Church, that is <hi>Abrahams</hi> family no longer; that believers the true ſons and heirs may come in, as in the 35. <hi>verſe. And the ſervant (ſaith Chriſt) abideth not in the houſe for ever; but the ſon abideth for ever. If therefore the ſon make you free,</hi> and that he doth not for all your former freedom, unleſſe you believe in him; <hi>then ſhall you be free indeed,</hi> even to the glory, oracles, and bleſſings of the ſpirituall houſe, the Goſpel Church, which elſe, you muſt be cut off from.</p>
                     <p>And ſo indeed it came to paſſe within a while, for not believing and repenting, which are the only terms which give right to Goſpel ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and priviledges. So that theſe Jews though Natural branches ſtill as much as ever (if being the fleſhly ſeed of a believer could help them,) as to a ſtanding there, were yet clean broke from the root <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he ſtands a root to all the faithful, becauſe only of unbelief <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. when ſuch as were <hi>wild olives,</hi> and no kin at all to <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh, were in their own perſons, but not their natural ſeed with them (ſave as they believed with them) owned as his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108740:24"/>
Children by believing, and as members of the true Church under the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>And this was declared by <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and the reſt of the firſt Miniſters of the Goſpel, who would not admit Jews as Jews (though <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> own ſeed) unto Baptiſm, when they offered themſelves upon the aforenamed terms without faith and repentance. See how the <hi>Phariſees, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,</hi> and whole multitude of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed come to be Baptized. <hi>Math.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Luke.</hi> 3.7. pretending and pleading that if Baptiſm were a Church priviledge, it muſt needs belong to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were the children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> But ſee how he rejects them, as having no part nor por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this matter. <hi>O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, what have you to do with the remiſſion of ſins and redemption from wrath, which I preach and baptize in token of, being (notwithſtanding your priviledges) corrupt and ſinful in your lives. <hi>Bring forth therefore,</hi> to the end you may be baptized, <hi>fruits anſwerable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life;</hi> and begin not to ſay, that we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our father, we are the ſeed of an eminent believer, for <hi>God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up childeen to Abraham.</hi> i. e. God will without being beholden to you, raiſe a ſeed to <hi>Abraham</hi> rather then to want them, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe ſtones; whether he means ſtones lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or the Gentiles, which were as ſtones in their eyes, it matters not.</p>
                     <p>But this we gather from it, that even at that very time, when the birth-priviledge and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108740:25"/>
of a fleſhly ſeed ſtood in full force, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealed (as then it did) how much more ſince the abrogation thereof by faith, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed could not, much leſs can the ſeed of believing Gentiles, now it is repeal'd, be admitted to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm without Repentance.</p>
                     <p>The Jews as impenitent and unbelieving as they were, ſtood uncaſt out of the Jewiſh Church, while the Church it ſelf ſtood: But they could not paſſe out of that Church into the Goſpel Church, nor from their right to circumciſion, prove their right to Baptiſm; yet this they might have done, if what gave right of old to one of thoſe ordinances, doth in like manner in right perſons to the other.</p>
                     <p>So then ſeeing <hi>Abrahams</hi> own ſeed had no right to Baptiſm, as ſuch, how can you expect it from your ſeed, who are not <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed: For <hi>Abraham</hi> hath but two ſeeds, as I know of (except <hi>Chriſt</hi>) the firſt is his ſeed after the fleſh, and ſuch were all thoſe that were born of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and his children by <hi>Keturah,</hi> and thoſe that come of him, by <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> which only were heirs with him of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (for <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold his birth-right.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His ſeed after the faith, and they are all thoſe that walk in his ſteps <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12. and ſuch that do his works <hi>John.</hi> 8. but to ſuppoſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> hath a third ſeed, and they are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believing Gentiles, is a fancy, for, <hi>non datur tertium ſemen Abrahae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two ſeeds of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Scripture mentions, but a third ſort cannot be aſſign'd, The firſt are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108740:25"/>
only theſe that deſcend from his loyns, as the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and others by <hi>Keturah;</hi> the <hi>Iſhmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> by <hi>Hagar;</hi> The <hi>Edomites,</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by <hi>Sarah;</hi> which laſt only were the holy ſeed, and children of promiſe, in reference to the <hi>Haga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi> in a type, and ſole heirs of the Typical <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> All theſe I ſay were the firſt ſort, and all believers of what Nation ſoever, are the ſecond ſort; but the natural ſeed of believers are neither of the one, nor of the other.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Poed.</speaker>
                     <p>But were not the proſelytes or ſtrangers counted <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and circumcis'd upon that account?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bap.</speaker>
                     <p>No: they were not <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and circumcis'd on that account; but from a poſitive inſtruction, &amp; an expreſſe command from God, as they were the males in the family of one that was a Jew, at leaſt by devotion, for which ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12.13. <hi>And he that is eight days old ſhall be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcis'd among you, every man child in your genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he that is born in the houſe, or bought with mony from any ſtranger, which is not of thy ſeed. He that is born in thy houſe, and he that is bought with mony, muſt needs be circumcis'd; and in</hi> Exod. 12.48.49. it is called <hi>a law, When a ſtranger ſhall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ with thee, and will keep the paſſeover, let all his males be circumcis'd, and then let him eat the the Paſſeover, and he ſhall be as one that is born in the land, and for the ſtranger.</hi> And in <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.14. it is called an Ordinance. <hi>Ye ſhall have one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for him that is born in the land, and for the ſtranger.</hi> Shew but ſo much for Infants-Baptiſm, that it is called a law, an ordinance, or hath any
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108740:26"/>
inſtitution for it, and the controverſy is ended. So that you ſee the <hi>proſclites</hi> were circumcis'd by vertue of a law, as they were Males in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed: for ſo they were not, nor heirs either of the temporal, or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Canaan.</hi> In the temporal <hi>Canaan</hi> they had no inheritance, nor any right to the heavenly, unleſs they were true believers as <hi>Abraham</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>So that the ſum of what hath been ſaid is:</p>
                     <p>Firſt the ſeed of believers, are not <hi>Abraham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi> ſeed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed are cut off from all the priviledges of the old Covenant, and are not all counted his ſeed, in the ſence of the new.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural ſeed have no right to the priviledges of the new Covenant, by vertue of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that ſeeing <hi>Abrahams</hi> own ſeed, his natural children, have no right to the Goſpel-Covenant, or priviledges thereof, much leſſe can the children of believing Gentiles lay any claim thereunto, either by vertue of <hi>Abraham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi> faith, or the faith of their own parents.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I might here end this matter; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſhall have full meaſure, I will add a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother teſtimony concerning the Covenant, and the little ground there is to baptize Infants, from that Scripture <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.</p>
                     <p>Know then that the Covenant of grace is to be conſidered, either of the promiſe of eternal life and ſalvation, made to all the elect in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the which remains one and the ſame in all ages, though variouſly adminiſtred, in the times of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108740:26"/>
old and new Teſtament. Or elſe of the manner of its Adminiſtration, in which ſence, its now (in reſpect of the old Teſtament adminiſtration) which was a diſtinct Covenant in it ſelf (for the time being) called the new Covenant, and the other to have waxen old, and to vaniſh away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>laſt.</hi> Which cannot be ſaid of the promiſe or Covenant of eternal life, that being an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant, and over remains one and the ſame. Now its one thing to be in the Covenant of grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> to have a right to the promiſe, which is only proper to the elect: another thing, to be under the adminiſtration of the Covenant, which is common to the elect and reprobates, and depends meerly upon Gods appointment.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Covenant be underſtood in the firſt ſence, of the promiſe of eternal life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made to the elect in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> that did never belong to all the children born of believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, as might be inſtanced in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau, &amp;c.</hi> but only to ſuch as are elected of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7.8.9. <hi>neither becauſe they are the ſeed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, are they <hi>all children,</hi> &amp;c. The Covenant of grace being firſt made between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; all the elect in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And therefore in Scripture it is cal'd <hi>the promiſe of eternal life which was made to the elect before the world began;</hi> who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the heirs of promiſe, which promiſe had its firſt promulgation to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the garden of <hi>Eden.</hi> Where we have alſo the firſt diſcovery of the myſtery of the two ſeeds.</p>
                     <p>Now the Covenant taken in this ſence, is not the ground and reaſon of adminiſtring ordinances
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108740:27"/>
to any perſon whatever. But the law of inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the ground or reaſon of viſible Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the adminiſtration of ordinances belongs not to the ſubſtance of the Covenant; but to its adminiſtration as to the perſons to whom they ſhall be adminiſtred, and that meerly on the law of inſtitution, without any other conſideration; and hence we finde, that from the firſt promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant to <hi>Adam,</hi> until Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was no ordinance to be adminiſtred to Infants, though ſome Infants as well as grown perſons, both of believers, and unbelievers might be comprehended in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant yet not to be circumcis'd, and ſo not to be baptiz'd for want of an inſtitution</p>
                     <p>So the promiſe in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>is ſaid to be to them a far off,</hi> in the preſent tenſe, while uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>even to as many as ſhall be called;</hi> and yet, not to be baptized before calling, unleſſe you will baptize Gentiles in profeſſed Gentiliſm; and ſo the Jews, ſome not yet born, ſome not cal'd, have the Covenant of grace made to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.27. <hi>For this is my Covenant unto them, when I ſhall take away their ſins;</hi> and yet they are not to be baptized till converted.</p>
                     <p>Nor can the Covenant, conſidered in its pure nature, be a miniſters rule to adminiſter Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances by, ſeeing it is unknown, who are in the Covenant, and who are not; but that which is their rule, muſt be ſomething that is manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when it is ſaid, that the Covenant of grace belongs to believers children, and that is the ground of their Baptiſm. If it be meant of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108740:27"/>
its Adminiſtration, you have heard, that depends meerly on the law of inſtitution, and hath varied in ſeveral ages according to the will of the law-giver. For during all that period of time, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was no Ordinance to be adminiſtred to Infants; but when God renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he inſtituted circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, which ordinance belongs peculiarly to the old Teſtament adminiſtration, and was part of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, which is now abrogated and done away: And this was the firſt ordinance that was adminiſtred to Infants and not to all Infants, but only to male Infants living in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family if they did live to the eight day, otherwiſe, they had no right to this ordinance; though many of them doubtleſſe in the Covenant of grace and ſo ſaved: ſo we ſay of Infants in the days of the Goſpel, many of them are in the Covenant of grace, and ſo ſaved, by vertue of the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: But yet not to be baptiſed, if they do not live to the time of believing and repenting, the only time appointed for Baptiſm: ſo that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of ordinances to Infants, depends upon an Inſtitution, and not upon their being in Covenant.</p>
                     <p>And as to that place <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed,</hi> that is, ſay you, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venat was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a believer, and ſo with all believers and their ſeed. To which I anſwer; The Covenant was not made with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and their ſeed; but with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. Now <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be conſidered under a double relation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:108740:28"/>Firſt, as the father of the Jews, his fleſhly ſeed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as he is the father of his ſpiritual ſeed, both Jews, and Gentiles; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.12. Now to both ſeeds, doth God promiſe to be a God, but in a different manner and reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he promiſes to be a God to his fleſhly ſeed, in giving to them the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an inheritance, the promiſe of which is expreſly called the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed as on Gods part, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.9.10.11.12. which Covenant he made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, <hi>unto thee will I give the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>the lot of your inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. See alſo 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.16.17.18. <hi>and Neh.</hi> 9.8. This, I ſay, was the Covenant on Gods part. And their obedience to circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is expreſly called the Covenant on their parts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you; Every male ſhall be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcis'd. So</hi> Act. 7.8. <hi>And he gave them the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Circumciſion, and ſo</hi> Abraham <hi>begat</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and circumcis'd him the eight day.</hi> By which they ſtood engaged to keep all thoſe other additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ordinances which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them, when they were about to enter their promiſed inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>I teſtify that whoever is Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd is bound to keep the whole law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, God promiſed to be a God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his ſpiritual ſeed; ſuch as walk in his ſteps, that is believers, whether Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, in giving unto them an eternal inheritance <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. incorruptible and undefiled, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away, purchaſed by the blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>

and reſeved for them in heaven: of which the earthly inheritance in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was but a type.</p>
                     <p>So, there is a twofold ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a ſpiritual, typed out by <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac:</hi> and a two-fold inheritance, an earthly and a heavenly. But the heavenly inheritance was not given to the fleſhy ſeed, but only in Types offered to them, and confirmed to the ſpiritual ſeed, who are therefore called the heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. Neither was the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> a pure Goſpel Covenant, but a mixt Covenant, conſiſting partly of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of temporal bleſſings, of which <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who is ſaid to be born by promiſe, was the true and proper heir. And partly of promiſes of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bleſſings, of an heavenly inheritance; and of theſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was the true her; and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typical <hi>Iſaac:</hi> for as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> the child of the fleſh had no right with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in the outward Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical promiſe; ſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> himſelf, by vertue of his fleſhly deſcent, had no right nor Intereſt in the heavenly inheritance, and Goſpel priviledges <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7. any otherwiſe then he came to have an intereſt in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore we find the Apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. expounding the word of promiſe <hi>(i. e.)</hi> I <hi>will be a God to thee, and thy ſeed;</hi> ſheweth that the Goſ-promiſes of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant were not made to any ones fleſhly ſeed, no, not with the meer fleſhly ſeed of believing <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf: but the promiſes did all run to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the inheriting ſeed to whom they were made; and when Chriſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108740:29"/>
was come they all center in him: ſee and conſider the text. Now to <hi>Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made; he ſaith not to ſeeds, as of many but as of one, and to thy ſeed which is Chriſt;</hi> to <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the type, but to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Antitype, and in him are all the promiſes yea and Amen.</p>
                     <p>Having thus followed the promiſes down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and found them all to center in him; let us now ſee, to whom they came forth again: And it is not to any ones fleſhly ſeed whatever; but from <hi>Chriſt</hi> they all flow forth again to believers, and only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and that by vertue of their union with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore ſays the <hi>Apoſtle; If ye be Christs then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſe,</hi> for there is no other way to partake of the promiſe but by faith in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe;</hi> where two things are obſervable; firſt, to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is given, <hi>viz.</hi> to them that believe; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by what means, they come to partake of them,; and that is, by the faith of Chriſt: ſo in <hi>verſe the</hi> 26. <hi>you are all the children of God, by faith in Jeſus Chriſt; and if ye be Chriſts,</hi> (that is by faith) <hi>then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe:</hi> So then it ſeems all promiſes run to Chriſt, and from him flow forth again only to believers. Which being impartially conſidered, is a full anſwer to all Arguments drawn from the Covenants, and the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and certainly and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108740:29"/>
unavoidably cuts off Infants Church memberſhip in the days of the Goſpel, unleſſe the <hi>Poedobaptiſts</hi> can finde a new inſtitution for it. But for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtration of this, and that you may ſee, that this is not my opinion alone, I ſhall preſent you with ſome ſelect paſſages that the judicious and eminent divine, Dr <hi>Owen</hi> hath upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it is in his <hi>Exercitations upon the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, tom.</hi> 1. p. 55. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which the Reader is referred, &amp; which by another hand may be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved; In the mean time take theſe few inſtances; <hi>Two Priviledges did God grant unto</hi> Abraham <hi>upon his ſeparation to a ſpecial intereſt in the old promiſe and Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, that according to the fleſh, he ſhould be the father of the</hi> Meſſiah; <hi>the promiſed ſeed, who was the very life of the Covenant, the fountain and cauſe of all the bleſſings contained in it. That this Priviledge was</hi> temporary, <hi>having a limited ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, time and end appointed unto it, the very nature of the thing it ſelf doth demonſtrate. For upon this actual exhibition in the fleſh, it was to ceaſe. In purſuit hereof, were his poſterity ſeparated from the reſt of the world, and preſerved a peculiar people, that through them the promiſed ſeed might be brought forth in the fulneſſe of time, and be of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 9.8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, together will this he had alſo another priviledge granted unto him, namely, that his ſaith whereby he was perſonally intereſted in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſhould be the pattern of the faith of the Church in all generations, and that</hi> none ſhould ever come to be a member of it, or a ſharer in its bleſſings,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108740:30"/>
but by the ſame faith that he had, fixed on the ſeed that was in the promiſe, <hi>to be brought forth from him in the world. On the account of this</hi> Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>he became</hi> the father of all them that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; <hi>for they that are of the faith, the ſame aere the children of</hi> Abraham Gal. 3.7. Rom. 4.11. <hi>as alſo heirs of the world;</hi> Rom. 4.13. <hi>in that all that ſhould believe throughout the world, being thereby implanted into the Covenant made with him, ſhould become his</hi> ſpiritual children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwerable unto this twofold end of the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Abraham, <hi>there was a double ſeed allo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. A ſeed according to the</hi> fleſh, <hi>ſeparated to the bringing forth of the</hi> Meſſiah, <hi>according to the fleſh; and a ſeed according to the promiſe, that is,</hi> ſuch as by faith have an Intereſt in the promiſe, or all the elect of God. <hi>Not that theſe two ſeeds were always ſubjectively divers; ſo that the ſeed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated to the bringing forth of the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>in the fleſh, ſhould neither in whole, or in part be alſo the ſeed according to the promiſe; or on the contrary, that the ſeed according to the promiſe, ſhould none of it be his ſeed after the fleſh. Our Apoſtle declares the contrary in the inſtancos of</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>with the remnant of</hi> Iſrael <hi>that ſhall be ſaved, Chap.</hi> 9.10.11. <hi>But ſometimes the ſame ſeed came under diverſe conſiderations, being the ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>both according to the fleſh and promiſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſeed it ſelf was divers, thoſe according to the fleſh being not of the promiſe, and ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Thus</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>were the ſeed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>according unto the fleſh, ſeparated unto the bringing forth of the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>after the fleſh, becauſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108740:30"/>
they were his carnal Poſterity, and they were alſo the ſeed of the promiſe, becauſe</hi> by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal faith they were Intereſſed in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> their father. <hi>Multitudes afterwards were of the carnal ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People ſeparated to bring forth the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>in the fleſh, and yet were not of the ſeed according to the promiſe, nor intereſted in the ſpiritual bleſſings of the Covenant,</hi> becauſe they did not perſonally believe, <hi>as our Apoſtle declares Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>of his Epiſtle. And many afterwards, who were not of the carnal ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>nor intereſted in the priviledge of bringing forth the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>in the fleſh, were yet deſigned to be made</hi> his ſpiritual ſeed by Faith, <hi>that in them he might become heir of the world, and all Nations of the Earth be bleſſed in him. Now it is evident, that it is the ſecond Priviledge and ſpiritual ſeed, wherein</hi> the Church to whom the Promiſes are made is founded, and whereof it doth conſiſt, namely in them, who by faith are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whether they be of the carnal ſeed or no.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And herein lay the great miſtake of the</hi> Jews <hi>of old, wherein they are followed by their Poſterity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day. They thought no more was needful to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt them in the Covenant of</hi> Abraham, <hi>but that they were his ſeed according to the fleſh, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly pleaded the latter Priviledge, as the ground and reaſon of the former. It is true, they were the children of</hi> Abraham <hi>according to the fleſh; but on that account, they can have no other Priviledge then</hi> Abraham <hi>had in the fleſh himſelf. And this was, as we have ſhewed, that he ſhould be ſet apart as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108740:31"/>
a ſpecial Channel, through whoſe loins God would derive the promiſed ſeed into the world. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were they ſeparated to be a peculiar people as his Poſterity, from among whom he ſhould be ſo brought forth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That this ſeparation and priviledge were to ceaſe, when the end of it was accompliſhed, and the</hi> Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah <hi>exhibited, the very nature of the thing declares. For to what purpoſe ſhould it be continued, when that was fully effected whereunto it was deſigned? but they would extend this priviledge, and mix it with the other, contending that becauſe they were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Abraham <hi>according to the fleſh, the whole bleſſing and Covenant of</hi> Abraham <hi>belonged unto them. But as our Saviour proved that in the latter ſenſe they were not the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not the works of</hi> Abraham; <hi>ſo as our Apoſtle plainly demonſtrates,</hi> Rom. 4.9.10.11. Chapters. Gal. 3.4. Chap. <hi>That thoſe of them who had not the faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>had no intereſt in his bleſſings and Covenant; ſeeing therefore that their other priviledge was come to an end with all the Carnal ordinances that attended it, by the actual coming of the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>whereunto they were ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if they did not by faith in the promiſed ſeed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Intereſt in this of the ſpiritual bleſſing, it is evident that they could on no account be conſidered as actually ſharers in the Covenant of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We have ſeen then that</hi> Abraham <hi>on the account of his faith and not of his ſeparation according to the fleſh, was the father of all that believe, and heir of the world. And in the Covenant made with him, as to that which concerns, not the bringing forth of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108740:31"/>
the promiſed ſeed according to the fleſh, but as unto faith therein; and in the work of redemption to be performed thereby, lyes the foundation of the Church in all ages. Whereſoever this Covenant is, and with whomſoever it is eſtabliſhed, with them is the Church, unto whom all the promiſes and Priviledges of the Church do belong. Hence it was, that at the coming of the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>there was not one Church taken away, and another ſet up in the room thereof, but the Church continued the ſame in thoſe that were the children of</hi> Abraham <hi>according to the faith. The Chriſtan Church, is not another Church, but the very ſame, that was before the coming of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>having the ſame faith with it, and intereſted in the ſame Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is true, the former Carnal Priviledges of</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Poſterity expiring on the grounds before mentioned, the Ordinances of worſhip which were ſuited thereunto did neceſſarily ceaſe alſo. And this caſt the</hi> Jews <hi>into great perplexityes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the laſt tryal that God made of them. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as both theſe, namely the carnal and ſpiritual Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of</hi> Abrahams <hi>Covenant, had been carried on together in a mixed way for many generations, coming now to be ſeparated, and a tryal to be made</hi> (Mal. 3) <hi>who of the Jews had Intereſt in both, who in one only, thoſe who had only the Carnal priviledge of being children of</hi> Abraham <hi>according to the fleſh, contended for a ſhare on that ſingle account in the other alſo, that is in all the Promiſes annexed unto the Covenant. But the foundation of their plea was taken away, and the Church unto which the promiſes belong remained with them,</hi> that were heirs of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108740:32"/>
                        <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith only.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It remains then, that the Church founded in the Covenant, and unto which all the promiſes did and do belong, abode at the coming of Chriſt, and doth abide ever ſince in and among thoſe who are the children of</hi> Abraham <hi>by faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And a little further he ſaith, <hi>No individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath any intereſt in the promiſes, but by vertue of his memberſhip with the Church, which is and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was one and the ſame, with whomſoever it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the promiſes are theirs: and that</hi> Not by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication or Analogie, but directly and properly. <hi>The Church unto whom all the promiſes belong, are only thoſe who are heirs of</hi> Abrahams <hi>Faith; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as he did, and thereby intereſted in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So far this learned man, whoſe words need no comment, nor need we draw any inference, but recite his bare words, which are both perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Orthodox; clearly and fully evidencing our poſition, <hi>That believers only are the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and none but ſuch have an Intereſt in the Covenant made with him,</hi> which unavoidably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes infants from Goſpel-Ordinances, untill they believe in their own perſons: And then, and not before, they may lay a juſt claim, <hi>that they are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> And if our opponents think Dr. <hi>O.</hi> inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (as they are apt to clamour to that purpoſe) for our improvement of his words to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he being for Poedobaptiſm; we ſay, that they are at liberty to reconcile his words to his practice if they can, to do which they have need
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108740:32"/>
of a conſiderable ſtock (but they are ſeldome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſht) of artifice, and diſtinction, to help at this dead lift. The Dr. treating about the nature of the Covenant and promiſes made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> (and perhaps forgetting Infant-Baptiſm) opens and expounds them with ſuch ſpirituality and Orthodoxy, as leaves no room for Infant Baptiſm, but excludes it beyond all poſſibility of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; unleſs it can be proved, that they, <hi>viz. Infants are heirs of</hi> Abrahams <hi>faith, believing as he did; and that the promiſes are theirs, not by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication or Analogie, but directly and properly, and by their own perſonal faith,</hi> which I deſpair ever to hear of; though Mr <hi>B.</hi> himſelf, that unparalleld diſtinguiſher, ſhould undertake it.</p>

                     <speaker>Poed.</speaker>
                     <p>But our Miniſters tells us, that when the promiſes are ſaid to be made to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is not meant of <hi>Chriſt</hi> perſonally, but of <hi>Chriſt</hi> myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. and ſo its to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the viſible Church, of which infants born of believing parents are a part.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bap.</speaker>
                     <p>Its true theſe are your ſayings: but, I muſt tell you, we muſt not be put off with fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and bare affirmations, but we expect ſolid proof from Scripture. And whereas you ſay, the promiſes are to be conſidered, as made to Chriſt myſtically, that is, to the viſible Church; the contrary appears in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. where he affirms that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the ſeed to whom the promiſes were made. And in <hi>vers.</hi> 19th. he ſaith; the law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, till the ſeed ſhould come, to whom the promiſe was made: where it is obſervable that the law <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108740:33"/>
Moſaical adminiſtration, is ſaid to be before the ſeed was come, and was to have its period then. Now, if by <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſeed be not underſtood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, but myſtically, for the viſible or inviſible Church, (take which you will) then the law could not have been before the ſeed; for God had his Church in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family 400 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law was, of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the head, and they his myſtical body. And ſo by this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, the ſeed ſhould have been before the law, contrary to the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> who makes the law to have been before the ſeed, and to have its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, when the ſeed to whom the promiſe was made, was come; and now the promiſes running to Chriſt perſonally, God makes him over for a Covenant to the Elect, and all the promiſes in him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. So that in <hi>Chriſt</hi> he is our God, and in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he takes us to be his people. In <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a right to the promiſes; out of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſtrangers to the Covenants of promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. So that it is evident, that the promiſes, reſpecting the eternal inheritance, and ſpiritual bleſſings were firſt made to <hi>Chriſt</hi> perſonally, and in him to his myſtical body, the Church, who are united to him by faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as to that Scripture 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <q>for as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are one body, ſo alſo is <hi>Christ:</hi>
                        </q> It rather ſeems to be meant of the inviſible Church of true believers, then of the viſible; for the <hi>Apostle</hi> there, calls none the body of <hi>Christ</hi> but ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad <hi>received the gifts of the ſpirit,</hi> and ſuch, as <hi>by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108740:33"/>
one</hi> ſpirit (as the concurring cauſe) had <hi>been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Zed into one body,</hi> yea ſuch <hi>who had received the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to profit withall,</hi> ſuch, <hi>that had a real ſympathy one with another, verſ. the</hi> 26th. <hi>If one Member ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers all the members ſuffer with it, if one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it:</hi> All which cannot (in any tolerable ſence) be applyed to the viſible Church, amongſt whom there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hypocrites, that never received the ſpirit, nor by the ſpirit could ſympathize one with another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But however, it is moſt certain infants are not called the body of Chriſt, if it be meant of the viſible Church indeed, by vertue of the grace of election, ſome of them may be members of his myſtical body, the inviſible Church, but not at all members of the viſible, eſpecially from this chapter; for it is ſaid, if one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; and the manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every one to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which cannot be applicable to infants.</p>
                     <p>For none in this Chapter are counted the body of Chriſt, but ſuch as are uſefull to the body, as an eye, an eare, or a foot, a hand, a head, &amp;c. as <hi>vers.</hi> 21. <hi>the eye cannot ſay unto the hand, I have no need of thee, nor the head to the feet I have no need of you.</hi> So that I draw theſe two concluſions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt every member in a Chuch ſtands in need of the help of all the other members.</p>
                     <p>Secondly that every member in a Church muſt be uſefull in his place to the reſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But of what uſe are infants to the reſt of the members in reſpect to edification?</p>
                     <p>Now this objection being anſwered, I hope
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108740:34"/>
you ſee plainly, that all the promiſes reſpecting ſpiritual bleſſings, and the eternal inheritance, were firſt made to Chriſt perſonally, and in him they are made over to his miſtical body, the Church, who are united to him by faith, which being well weighed would put an end to the whole Controverſy.</p>
                     <p>And in the next place you may ſee to what lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe, the promiſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. is brought to prove, that God made a Covenant of eternal life with believers and their Children.</p>
                     <p>The text ſpeaks of a Covenant made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his ſeed, it doth not ſay with all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and their ſeed, or all Church-members and their ſeed, neither doth it follow by any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence, that becauſe God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, therefore he hath made a Covenant with believers and their ſeed; ſure I am, the Apoſtle was of another mind, who when he expounds the Covenant <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. underſtands it to be made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> (as it contains Goſpel bleſſings) not as a natural father but as the father of the faithfull, both Jews and Gentils, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>he received the ſign ef Circumciſion that he might be the father of all them that believe, and walk in the ſteps of the faith of our father</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſo</hi> Gal. 3.7. <hi>know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the ſame are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Abraham;</hi> And theſe only are the ſeed to whom the Covenant was made (in reſpect to Goſpel priviledges) and not to the natural ſeed either of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or of any other believers, as hath been evidently made appear before, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108740:34"/>
that beyond all Contradiction: And whoever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms otherwiſe preaches another Goſpel then <hi>Paul</hi> knew, and incurrs that doom mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>

                     <p>in anſwer to which, I grant there was a time, when the Jews and their children were broken off, as the Apoſtle ſaith, but there are two things to be conſidered. Firſt, why they were broken off. Secondly, from what they were broken off.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Why? Anſw. It was not becauſe they had not believing Parents; for <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> were the fathers of them all, and upon whoſe account they had right to the priviledges of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Not becauſe they wanted title, for they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, when they were broken off; but,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe the terms of ſtanding in the Church were now altered; and the Church it ſelf remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: For before the Goſpel came they ſtood members of the old Church, though as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers for many generations, as they were when they were broken off; and why did not their unbelief break them off before?</p>
                     <p>But now <hi>Abrahams</hi> Church ſtate is at an end, and all the priviledges and immunities ceaſe;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108740:35"/>
the Jewiſh Church muſt give way to the Goſpel Church; the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> being come, and about to build him a new houſe, into which none are (of right) to enter, but profeſt believers; and the Jews not believing now in that ſaviour who has the ſubſtance of the ſhadows, and which all their types pointed out, and whom all thoſe ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſignified, yea for whoſe ſake they did enjoy their ordinances, and to which end were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them the oracles of God, the giving of the law, and the promiſes; yea therefore was their ſeed counted holy, to point out, and keep them in memory of that holy child <hi>Jeſus</hi> that was to come as the Anti-type of all theſe things: For the old houſe, or Jewiſh Church was not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to abide for ever, but to the time of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then the law muſt be changed, the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood chang'd, the priviledges and ordinances chang'd, the ſeed chang'd, yea the Covenant chang'd, which they not believing, being willing to abide in the old houſe ſtill, and to remain Churchmembers upon a meer fleſhly and natural birth; ſtill crying out, <hi>Abraham</hi> is our father, and we are his ſeed, and are free, and were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in bondage: and here it ſeems they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſtand; wherefore they were broken off, and that whether they would or not, by reaſon of their unbelief, that is, becauſe they would not believe that the old Covenant and all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges thereof were ended, and the ſubſtance come, the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Antitype of their types.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing is, from what they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:108740:35"/>I anſwer, From all the glory they boaſted ſo much of; as the Apoſtle ſayes; thou art called a Jew, and makeſt thy boaſt of God, and truſteſt in the law; but all theſe things are now gone, yea the Typical Adoption, the glory, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, the giving of the law, and the ſervice of God and the promiſes; all their birth-priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Church memberſhip and ordinances; which continued but till the time of reformation; yea from that Covenant, which had alſo ordinances of divine ſervice, and a worldly ſanctuary, which is now all aboliſhed, as you ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1.2.3.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all becauſe they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, who was the Antitype and ſubſtance of all their ſhadows; but were willing to abide in the old houſe ſtill, and loath to loſe their outward priviledges, their worldly ſanctuary, their ordinances and Church memberſhip upon the account of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, for it was indeed an eaſy ſervice, a fleſh pleaſing religion, (if ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation could have been obtained by it) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the bondage and laboriouſneſs of ſome ſervices, yet how willing would the carnal <hi>Jew</hi> have born all, if he might have been ſaved by the faith of another, rather then to loſe all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the law, and to count his circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Church memberſhip as dung to winn <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did when converted, <hi>and be found in him only, not having his own righteouſneſſe which is of the law, but that which is by faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee why the Jews ars broken off, and from what. But they are not all broken off from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108740:36"/>
the Goſpel Covenant, for there is yet a remnant according to the election of grace, and as many of them as believe, and repent of their ſins ſhall be admitted to the more eaſy, and more excellent priviledges of the Goſpel Church memberſhip and ordinances, and ſhall be a pillar in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and ſhall go no more out.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, we ſee many of the Jews have been converted, and ſhall be more generally in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſay, <hi>May not the children of the Jews, be broken off from the Goſpel Covenant?</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                     <p>They are no more broken off, then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Gentiles; for thoſe that dye in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as many as belong to the election of grace ſhall be ſaved: if they live to years of diſcretion, and then believe they ſhall be ſaved, as ſoon as any children of believing gentiles.</p>
                     <p>But if the children of the Jews, be broken off from the Goſpel Covenant, it is either becauſe of their parents unbelief, or their own perſonal unbelief. If it be meerly their parents unbelief, then if any do believe in their own perſons they cannot be admitted, becauſe of their parents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, for that which cuts them off, will keep them off; and ſo the parents unbelief keeps the children from the Goſpel Covenant, and ſo, is the cauſe of their damnation, for <hi>cauſa cauſae, eſt cauſa cauſati.</hi> But where do we finde that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be damn'd for the ſins of their parents; the Scripture ſaith, the ſoul that ſins ſhall dye.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſay, <hi>the Jews unbelief doth not keep
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108740:36"/>
their children from the Covenant of grace, but only from the adminiſtrations of it, as Baptiſm, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that according to your principles, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to the ſame thing, for you ſay out of the Church no ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>But if you ſay <hi>their parents unbelief keeps them out of the Church, only during their infancy, when they come to years, if they believe, they may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:</hi> Then it will follow that ſuch children of the Jews, yea of all unbelievers that dye in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy are in a miſerable condition, their caſe is deplorable, for their parents <hi>(ſecundum te)</hi> can have no hopes of their ſalvation. Poor ſouls! had you lived a while longer, you had been in the Covenant of grace, and enjoy'd the priviledges thereof, but meerly becauſe of your parents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief you are cut off while you are infants.</p>
                     <p>But if this be true, parents have cauſe to mourn to the breaking of their loynes, when their children dye. But <hi>David</hi> was of another mind, who when his child dyed, rejoyced though it dyed on the ſeventh day, the day before cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſion, and that not without hopes of its good eſtate, as learned men conceive; for he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall go to that, but that ſhall not return to me;</hi> which is not meant only of going to the grave, but to a ſtate of happyneſſe, for our going barely to the grave, is no cauſe of comfort.</p>

                     <p>But we are told, that Circumciſion was a great priviledge, as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. <hi>What advantage is there of Circumciſion? much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way;</hi> and therefore, to be broken off, was their miſery.</p>

                     <speaker>Bap.</speaker>
                     <p>Its true the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> propounds that queſtion, what profit is there of Circumciſion? his meaning is, that there was a time when they had advantage by circumciſion, and the main was, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould come of their fleſh; of whom, as concerning the fleſh <hi>Chriſt</hi> came. But this and all other advantages are ceaſed, and now it is a mercy rather then a miſery, (though they thought otherwiſe) to be broken off from the Covenant of Circumciſion; and that it is ſo I ſhall make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from theſe Arguments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If ſtanding in the Covenant of Circumciſion, did keep up the expectation of Chriſt to come, and ſo deny him to be already come in the fleſh, then their breaking off from that Covenant was a mercy not a miſery.</p>
                     <p>But the Antecedent is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If while the Jew and his ſeed now ſtand in the Covenant of Circumciſion, Chriſt did profit them nothing: then to be broken off from that Covenant is a mercy, not a miſery.</p>
                     <p>But the Antecedent is true <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. <hi>If ye be circumcis'd Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing,</hi> (that is if you now continue in the old Covenant) <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the conſequent.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If while the Jew and his ſeed ſtand in the Covenant of Circumciſion, they go about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own righteouſneſſe, and do not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the righteouſneſſe of God: then to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the covenant is a mercy not a miſery.</p>
                     <p>But the antecedent is true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> ſo is the conſequent.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:108740:37"/>4. If the ſtanding in the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion did oblige them to keep the whole Law, then their breaking off is a mercy, not a miſery. But the Antecedent is true; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>I teſtify, ſays</hi> Paul, <hi>that every one that is Circumciſed is bound to keep the whole law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the conſequent.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If while the Jews ſtand in the Covenant of Circumciſion they cannot be juſtified in the ſight of God; then to be broken off is a mercy not a miſery.</p>
                     <p>But the Antecedent is true, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the conſequent.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears that though the Jews thought it a miſery to be broken off from the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from Circumciſion and Church memberſhip, from the priviledge of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; yet it was indeed their mercy if they did believe and embrace the Goſpel; for now they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from all their yokes, and cruel bondage, yea, from the curſe of the law; <hi>for Chriſt hath redeemed as many of them as believe from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> And if it be objected, then their unbelief was a mercy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It doth not follow that becauſe their breaking off was a mercy, therefore the means by which, was a mercy, for the death of Chriſt was a mercy, but the means of effecting it was not ſo; for they did it by wicked hands.</p>
                     <p>But had the Jewes believed, they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have broke off themſelves, but becauſe they did not, they were broken off, contrary to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108740:38"/>
their own wills, (though for their good). For though it be not a mercy for any perſon to be broke off from any mercy God gives, during the time it is to be enjoyed; But if greater privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges be offered, and they ſhall adhere to the worſe, (and there being a period put to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) then 'tis their mercy rather then their miſery to be forced out whether they will or no: as it is a mercy for a man to live in his own houſe, and enjoy the benefits and priviledges thereof; But if that houſe be like to fall upon his head, it is his mercy to be forced out of it, whether he will or not. So <hi>Lot</hi> would willingly have ſtaid in <hi>Sodom,</hi> for the text ſaith he lingred, but God being mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto him, forced him out, ſo the Jews would have ſtaid longer in the old Covenant, but God being merciful unto them, took away all their priviledges, and concluded them all under ſin, and made them all as well as Gentiles guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before God, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>

                     <p>But if Circumciſion and all the Jews pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges did hold out Chriſt to come in the fleſh, then they ſhould have been broken off as ſoon as Chriſt came, but they were not.</p>

                     <p>Its true they were not broken off <hi>de facto,</hi> but <hi>de jure</hi> they were; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> was yet graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them, and tendred the Goſpel firſt to them as you have heard, ſaying, he was not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time after the Apoſtles preach'd to the Jews, till they contradicting and blaſpheming, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid; It was neceſſary the word of God
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108740:38"/>
ſhould be firſt ſpoken unto them But ſeeing you put it from you, and ſo judge your ſelves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternal life, loe, we turn to the Gentiles, whence we may obſerve.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How tender the Lord Jeſus and his Apoſtles were to theſe people, and that becauſe they had all the types of Chriſt coming in the fleſh, and the ſhaddows of good things to come, and it was a great pitty that <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for, and that they which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the law of righteouſneſs have not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the law of righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. We may obſerve that they broke off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet not all, the Apoſtle ſaith, 'tis but ſome of the branches are broken off, that is, ſome of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, for blindneſs is but in part hap'ned to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> And they alſo if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide not in unbelief ſhall be grafted in again.</p>
                     <p>So then it is a great miſtake to think that all <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and their ſeed are broken off from the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant, and the Gentiles and their ſeed come in their room, and ſo their children to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Church priviledges, as memberſhip and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. For the Jews, that is the whole lump of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, are not broken off from the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant, but ſome only that abide in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but for others of them that do believe, they have ſtill as great a priviledge, and as much a right to Goſpel ordinances as any believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils in the world. 'Tis true they are all broken off from the old Covenant, that could not give life, that made nothing perfect, which as you have heard is their mercy rather then miſery, if they could believe it.</p>

                     <p>But me thinks, believers Children ſhould have ſome priviledge above the children of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, or elſe they will loſe ſome priviledge by the coming of Chrrſt, and the Goſpel diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be leſs then that of the law.</p>

                     <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it muſt be prov'd that Baptiſm is any priviledge at all to infants, for we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that ordinances are the hard part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and ſo, rather a burthen then a priviledg, without faith; they are part of Chriſts yoke, and though they be made eaſy to believers from their intereſt in Chriſt, and the hope of the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward, yet they are a burthen to the fleſh, both in reſpect to the performance of them, and the conſequences of them; yea rather a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and a yoke then a mercy, and a priviledge, where there is no faith to make them eaſy. But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. If Circumciſion were a priviledge, (though the Apoſtle calls it a yoke) it muſt be conſidered, whether our infants are capable of ſuch priviledges by Baptiſm, as theirs were by Circumciſion: for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Circumciſion did aſſure them that Chriſt ſhould be born of their loyns.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It did inright them to the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> none of which we can expect.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By Circumciſion you ſay they were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gods people, and this is the only thing you mean. But,</p>
                     <p>Is it ſo great a priviledge to have the name without the nature? the ſhadow without the ſubſtance? We uſe to count that a miſery rather
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108740:39"/>
then a mercy: and <hi>Sardis</hi> is blamed for having a name to live and was dead. Is it any benefit for a man to be counted rich when he is poor: we ſee <hi>Naomies</hi> modeſty is commended, who would not own the ſhadow without the ſubſtance; call me no more <hi>Naomi,</hi> but call me <hi>Marah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in the next place, you ſay infants unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd loſe ſome priviledge: I ſay ſome things that were counted priviledges are loſt, for it was a priviledge, that all the ſons of the prieſts were born Prieſts, but it is not ſo now. But further; Its you your ſelves make your children loſe a priviledge ſince the coming of Chriſt, and ſo make the new Covenant narrower then the old: And that becauſe the faith of a believing parent, as you ſay, admits only your immediate children to Church memberſhip and Baptiſm, but as to your childrens children, they have no benefit by your faith, no admittance to Ordinances upon your account; but it was otherwiſe of old; the Covenant of circumciſion, and the priviledges of Church memberſhip, was not only to the next generation flowing from <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to his ſeed after him in their generations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. and that not only to the third and fourth generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to Chriſts time, they enjoyed the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Covenant by vertue of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith. But now you have narrowed the Goſpel diſpenſation, for you allow Baptiſm to none but your immediate ſeed, by vertue of the parents faith: your childrens children muſt come in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another account, their parents muſt be actual believers or elſe no admittance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:108740:40"/>But what reaſon you have for ſo doing I know not, yea, I chalenge any man to give me a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial ground, why the faith of a believer may not now as well inright his childrens children to the 3d &amp; 4th generation to Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm, as the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> did inright his ſeed in their generations to the priviledges of the old Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Will you ſay <hi>Abraham</hi> was a famous believer, and therefore had this priviledge above others? Theſe are indeed your ſayings; but muſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it therefore? where is it ſo ſaid? or what neceſſary conſequence is there from any Scripture, to enforce belief, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſonal faith ſhall inright him and his ſeed in their generations? But a believers faith in the days of the Goſpel (though in ſome reſpect more excellent then that of <hi>Abraham) viz.</hi> in reference to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, and Redemption compleated) ſhall inright only his immediate children ſuch as are born of his loynes: ſo that <hi>you make the Goſpel diſpenſation narrower then that of the law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>if believers children are not baptized, they have no priviledge above the children of heathens.</hi> I anſwer, That had God ſo appointed, that believers children ſhould have been baptized, and unbelievers children ſhould not, you had ground then to conſider it as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge; but ſeeing there is no inſtitution, you cannot ſay, they are denyed a priviledge: but if it be a priviledge, then (according to your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe) you run a great hazard of denying Baptiſm to ſuch to whom it doth belong.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:108740:40"/>For if I ſhould ask you, what ſort of believers they are, whoſe children have a right to Baptiſm, here you would be at a loſſe, and muſt needs ſay, ſuch only whom you count believers as your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe evidently proves: but it was not ſo of old, it was certainly known, what children had a right to Circumciſion, and what had not: but if you do (as you do) baptize the children only of ſuch parents as you count believers, then you may leave out many thouſands of children that have as great a right to it as yours. For there are no perſons called by the name of Chriſtians, but do count themſelves believers, yea doubtleſſe there are many believers amongſt them to whoſe children you deny Baptiſm, for,</p>
                     <p>Let it be conſidered how many ſorts there are, who count themſelves believers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> have their believers, and they are ſuch, as own Chriſt to be the ſon of God, and believe all the Articles of the Church of <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> amongſt whom ſurely God hath ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for it is ſaid, <hi>come out of her my people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> have their believers, that is, ſuch whom they count ſo, and they are ſuch that believe that Chriſt is the ſon of God, that he dyed for ſinners, and that whoever believes in him ſhall be ſaved, and ſo the whole nation own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and profeſſing the faith of Chriſt, they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize all their children, amongſt whom there are many thouſand real believers, and ſo their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have as much right to Baptiſm as yours.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have their believers, and they are ſuch (that is, ſo accounted) who own
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108740:41"/>
the faith of Chriſt, profeſſe regeneration, and are morally righteous in their lives and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Independents</hi> have their believers, and they are ſuch who own the faith of Chriſt, make a perſonal manifeſtation of their faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſo are enchurcht and become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (by a Covenant) of ſome particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</p>
                     <p>Now pray tell me which of all theſe ſorts of believers have right to have their children bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? If you ſay all of them, then you contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict your own practiſe, it being famouſly known, that ſome of you will baptize none but them of your own party. But if you ſay thoſe children on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have right to Baptiſm, whoſe parents we count believers, then you run a hazard of denying Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to the children of diverſe whoſe parents are as true believers as your ſelves, and ſo deny them the priviledges of the Covenant, and in as much as in you lyes occaſion their damnation, as you uſe to tell the Baptiſt.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſay, ſo the Baptiſts themſelves may keep perſons from Baptiſm, to whom of right it doth belong, and ſo are equally guilty.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that cannot be, for our principles are, that no perſon hath right to Baptiſm, but he that deſires it upon the profeſſion of his faith and repentance: to ſuch a perſon we do not deny it, unleſſe his profeſſion be contradicted by an unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life. By all which it appears,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That you (practically) deny the priviledge of Baptiſm to many that have as real a right to it, as your ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:108740:41"/>2. That you count the children of diverſe true believers to be in no better condition then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You do extreamly narrow the Goſpel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, (a fault you uſe, though unjuſtly, to charge the Baptiſts with) and ſo make the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Goſpel, leſſe then the priviledges of the law; for whereas of old all the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> all his numerous poſterity were circumcis'd, and that whether their parents believed, or not, there was no queſtioning of their faith, no enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into their converſations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now you, (practically) own no children to have right to Baptiſm, but thoſe whoſe immediate parents have given ſome viſible demonſtration of their converſion, and manifeſted their faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, who are ſo few, that were their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber reckoned up, it would not amount to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a hundred of them that are true believers, in the world.</p>
                     <p>But further, if the children of believers only (as you ſay) have right to the Covenant and Baptiſm, and that of ſuch believers as you count ſo; and ſo, their parents, only, have hope of their ſalvation; then what ſhall become of the children of unbelievers, yea of ſuch, whom you count unbelievers? may not they make this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to their parents, and ſay? O wretched and miſerable parents, that have brought forth ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable an off ſpring; other children as ſoon as they are born are in the Covenant of grace, and by vertue of their parents faith, have aright to Church memberſhip and baptiſm, wherein they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108740:42"/>
are made children of God, heirs of Chriſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors of the kingdom of heaven. But wo and alas to us, that ever we were born of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parents, or at leaſt of ſuch that were never enchurcht, nor members of any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independant</hi> congregation. We are unholy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, doggs that muſt not meddle with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread, without the pale of the Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens from the common weal of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> without hope and without God in the world. We muſt not be admitted to the priviledges of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, though diverſe of our parents are profeſſed Chriſtians, and believe Chriſt crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet becauſe they have not made a perſonal manifeſtation of their faith and repentance, and ſo joyned to ſome Church diverſe miniſters will not admit us to Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>But ſtay children, there is hope for you for all this: If you dye in infancy, as many of you, as belong to the election of grace ſhall be ſaved, though ye are not baptized, and if you live to years of diſcretion, and underſtanding, if then you believe in Chriſt and repent of your ſins, and obey the Goſpel, you ſhall be ſaved as ſoon as they, yea upon thoſe terms, and none other, ſhall thoſe that are Baptized in their infancy be ſaved if they live to years of underſtanding.</p>

                     <p>Well Sir I ſee, it is a hard matter to prove that the infants of believers have a right to the Covenant, more then the infants of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, but yet methinks they ſhould have right to the adminiſtration of the Covenant.</p>

                     <p>In no wiſe; and that for the want of an
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108740:42"/>
inſtitution, as you have heard, and it is anſwer enough to ſatisfy any that are willing to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd: for none ever had a right to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the Covenant any otherwiſe then by vertue of a law; had it been otherwiſe of old, then <hi>Enoch, Lot, Noah,</hi> and their ſeed had been circumcis'd; and <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> and others had not been circumcis'd: now if the natural bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> had not this priviledge to be circumcis'd by vertue of a right, but vertue of a law, how can you expect that your infants ſhould have a right to the adminiſtrations of the Covenant by vertue of your faith? Beſides you your ſelves deny one adminiſtration to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but what reaſon you have for ſo doing I know not, ſeeing the ſame grace is ſignified in both. Will you ſay, becauſe your children are not capable to examine themſelves? then let them plead their own cauſe, and ſuppoſe they ſhould make this <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> to their parents?</p>
                     <p>O, our tender and indulgent parents, you have brought us into the viſible Church as you ſay, and admitted us to Baptiſm and memberſhip; but why muſt we not partake of the Lords ſupper, that ſoul ſtrenghtning and ſoul-nouriſhing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? you take care to feed our bodies dayly, and that in order to our growth, and have you no pitty to our ſouls? muſt they ſtarve? the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Jews of old were admitted to the paſſeover, all the males were to appear thrice in a year, and very early partook of that Sacrament, and were inſtructed in the uſe and end of it, and have we loſt this priviledge by this coming of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108740:43"/>
Chriſt? beſides the ancient Church did uſe it, for many years, and muſt we be kept from it till we be come of age? yea, and not then neither (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our Baptiſm contrary to all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture preſident) unleſs we make a perſonal mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of our faith and repentance. Will you ſay, it is becauſe we cannot examine our ſelves? We anſwer that Scripture concerns the Adult, not us. You might as well have kept us from Baptiſm, becauſe we could not believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; but ſurely the Apoſtle never intended that infants ſhould examine themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Beſides you ſay we are clean, holy with a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral holyneſs, innocent, in the Covenant of grace, Church members, that we have habituall faith, and without any ſin (except original) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no need of ſelf-examination. Why then are we not admitted? will our parents faith ſerve to admit us to Baptiſm, and not to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? Who will unriddle this? ſurely we want ſome <hi>Alexander</hi> to cut this Gordian knot; for none will ever untie it.</p>
                     <p>But again; if infants have a right to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Covenant by vertue of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faith, then if the parents turn Atheiſts, or Apoſtates, the children loſe their right, and are caſt out from the ſaid priviledges. That it muſt be ſo appears, if we conſider, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>thou ſtandeſt by faith;</hi> (that is, ſay you) thou ſtandeſt in the Goſpel Covenant, and haſt right to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances by vertue of their own faith; and thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by vertue of thine. Now this ſtanding is not unalterable, a ſtate which cannot be fallen from;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108740:43"/>
but a changable ſtate from which thou mayſt fall, for the Apoſtle adds, <hi>be not high minded, but fear.</hi> Now if thou falleſt by unbelief, and ſo caſts out thy ſelf, thy children muſt needs be caſt out with thee; for <hi>ablatâ cauſâ tollitur effectus,</hi> take away the cauſe, and the effect ceaſeth: thy perſonal and actual faith was the ground and cauſe of thy Childrens admittance, ſo then thy unbelief muſt diſpriviledge them, for ſo it was with the Jews when they were cut off, how many thouſands of their infants were cut off with them from mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip &amp; ordinances, &amp; remain ſo to this day by reaſon of their parents unbelief; And do you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a greater priviledge then the natural bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: the Apoſtle lays them in an equal ballance <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22. and what ground have you to expect better; the unbelief of their parents broke off their Children: By unbelief they were broken off, and thy ſtanding is but conditional, if thou abide in his goodneſs, otherwiſe thou ſhalt be cut off. By which you ſee what abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and contradictions to your own practiſe, your opinion leads to; if the father be caſt out, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt be caſt out with him.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee that as the children of believers have no right to the Covenant of grace, more then the Children of unbelievers, by vertue of their parents faith; ſo, they have no right to the adminiſtration of the Covenant, for want of an inſtitution, there being no precept nor preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the word of God for ſuch a practiſe.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It's true in ſome caſes, it doth not, but in the matter of poſitive worſhip, we have the opinion of diverſe able and Godly men, who have told us, that <hi>what is not commanded in the worſhip of God, is forbidden,</hi> and that <hi>every affirmative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt includes a negative.</hi> But if it be true that a negative Argument concludes not in matters of Worſhip; then this had been a good plea for <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu; Levit.</hi> 10. who were deſtroyed for offering ſtrange fire which God had not commanded, they might have ſaid; Lord, its true thou haſt not commanded this ſtrange fire, ſo thou, haſt not forbid it, and <hi>a negative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment don't conclude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumciſe the eighth day, but he did not forbid the 7th day, <hi>And a negative Argument don't conclude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So in the paſſeover God commanded a Lamb, a male of the 1ſt year to be eaten; but he did not forbid an ewe, or a Ram of the 2d or 3d year, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108740:44"/>
                        <hi>a negative Argument don't conclude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So, God ſmote <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zZah</hi> for holding the Ark, but he might have ſaid; Lord thou haſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid me to ſupport the Ark, when the Oxen did ſhake it and <hi>a negative Argument don't conclude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So, when God threatens Idolatrous <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for cauſing their ſons and daughters to paſſe through the fire to <hi>Molech, which the Lord commanded not, neither came it into his heart Jer.</hi> 32.35. Yet they might ſay, though he had not commanded it, ſo he had not forbidden it, and <hi>a negative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment don't conclude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So, God hath not forbid Crucifixes, beads, Altars, praying to Saints, Images in Churches, pilgrimages, the Croſſe in Baptiſm <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>a Negative Argument don't conclude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So God hath not forbid unbelievers children to be Baptized, nor the children of believers to communicate in the Lords ſupper; and <hi>a negative Argument don't conclude.</hi>

                     <p>If God had pleaſed he could have made them

                     <p>Horrible then, and more then heatheniſh, is the impiety of thoſe, who mixing humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and appointments of their own with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of God, and impoſing them as divine duties, with a neceſſity of obedience, do by that means take Chriſts divine prerogative out of his own hands, and ſo make themſelves joynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of his Sacraments; yea rather indeed the deſtroyers of them; For he that practiſes an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance otherwiſe then Chriſt hath inſtituted, doth not honour the Ordinance but an Idol of his own making.</p>
                     <p>This the Apoſtles durſt not do; they tell us they declared unto them the Counſell of God; but nothing elſe.

                     <p>This therefore ſhould be a boundary to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that they deliver nothing to the people, but what they have received from the Lord. That faith that was once delivered to the Saints muſt be preach'd and contended for, but nothing elſe: and if Miniſters have not received Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm from the Lord, and if they cannot prove that it was once delivered unto the Saints, it is not to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108740:46"/>
be preached. It is ſad to think how full our pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits are of vain traditions and humane mixtures; as if the all-wiſe God wanted the help of dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey'd man to mend his worſhip by mixing their Inventions with Gods inſtitutions. But as to mixtures they are uſeful only for theſe two pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; either to ſlacken and abate ſomething that is exceſſive; or to ſupply ſomething that is deficient: And ſo all heterogeneous mixtures do plainly intimate, either a vitiouſneſſe to be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or a defect to be ſupplyed: Now it were great wickedneſſe to charge any of theſe upon the pure and perfect word of God, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to uſe deceit by adulterating of it; either by ſuch gloſſes as diminiſh and take away the force of it, or by the addition of humane Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as argue any defect. So that to ſtamp any thing (of but an humane original) with a divine character, and obtrude it upon the conſciences of men; to take any dead child of ours, as the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot did, and lay in the boſome of the Scripture, and father it upon God; to build any Structure of ours in the road to Heaven, and ſo ſtop up the way; is one of the higheſt, and moſt daring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions that the pride of man can aſpire unto: To erect a throne in the conſciences of his fellow creatures, and to counterfeit the great ſeal of heaven for the countenancing his own forgeries, is a ſin moſt ſeverely provided againſt by God, with ſpecial prohibitions and threatnings: ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>s to worſhip a falſe God, or the true God in a falſe manner.</hi> And that appears from the Second Commandment, where all kinde of Idolatry is forbidden, as all ſin is forbidden in the ten Commandements, though not in expreſſe words, yet in the meaning thereof; For it is a received Maxime, <hi>That all ſins forbidden by the word, are reducible to the</hi> 10 <hi>Commandements, and fall under the prohibition of one of them, or other:</hi> For upon the two tables of the law, hang all the law and the prophets, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.40. Now it is plain, all ſins are not contained in the letter of the Commandements; and therefore we muſt open the later by <hi>Synechdoche's,</hi> and <hi>Metonymies; Synechdoches</hi> do comprehend all ſins of the like kinde, and all the degrees thereof: and <hi>Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> do comprehend all cauſes, and means, and occaſions thereof; ſo that for opening the 2d. Commandement, which forbids both making and the worſhiping any image or ſimilitude, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to conſider in what ſence or reſpect Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or ſimilitudes are forbidden.</p>
                     <p>Images or ſimilitudes then, are forbidden, not as Objects of worſhip, for all falſe objects of worſhip, are the falſe Gods forbidden in the firſt Commandement: but Images and ſimilitudes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108740:48"/>
are forbidden in the 2d Commandement, not as falſe objects or worſhip, wherein the worſhip of God is terminated; but as falſe means of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping the true God. The <hi>Golden Calf</hi> was not conſidered as the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but as an Image of that <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which brought them out of <hi>Egipt;</hi> whence it is ſaid that <hi>Aaron</hi> proclaimed a feaſt, not to the Calfe, but to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whereof the Calfe was an Image: the Calfe then was not the God, but an Image of that God they worſhipped, as that which reſembled him, and put them in minde of him.</p>
                     <p>And then further, the Image forbidden in the 2d Commandement, is, not only a falſe means of worſhip deviſed by man; but a falſe manner alſo: and therefore when the <hi>Samaritan</hi>-ſtrangers knew not the manner of worſhiping God in the Calves of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> it is ſaid <hi>they knew not the manner of the God of the Country</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.26. and one of the Prieſts was ſent to teach them the manner of fear (or worſhip) of <hi>Jehovah;</hi> and ſo they feared <hi>Jehovah</hi> after the ſame manner that was in ſerving him after their own deviſing.</p>
                     <p>So that under this one kinde of falſe worſhip is forbidden by a <hi>Synechdoche</hi> not only all worſhip of God in carved, moulten, or painted Images (all bodily repreſentations) of God; but all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Images too, which are the Imaginations and inventions of man, whether they be ordained for worſhip, as the high places, and the deviſed feaſt of the eighth Month 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.33. or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be brought in, and uſed as helps and means of worſhip, as the ſtrange fire of <hi>Nadab
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108740:49"/>
Lev.</hi> 10, and <hi>Davids</hi> new Cart to carry the <hi>Ark;</hi> he did not make a new <hi>Ark,</hi> but a new cart; which deviſe of his, there being no command for it, fell under the condemnation of the ſecond Commandement. And ſo all Images and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of men, all forms and manner of worſhip, deviſed by man, and not ordained by God are forbidden as Idolatrous.</p>

                     <p>No, it is not more ſtrange then that there are ſo many learned men againſt the Proteſtant Religion; and eſpecially againſt your practiſe of baptizing the children of believers only, and upon thoſe grounds you do it; for the whole Chriſtian world (as its called) of learned men are againſt your grounds of baptizing Infants, for they adminiſter Baptiſm for the <hi>taking away of Original ſin,</hi> and to <hi>confer grace,</hi> and that not reſtrained to ſuch believers Infants, as you do it, but to the Infants of <hi>all perſons</hi> in the nations where they live: ſo that your opinion is a very novelty.</p>

that Infant-Baptiſm was very early oppoſed, and for any thing I know as ſoon as it was born, for no Antiquity mentions Infant-Baptiſm to have any peaceable being in the world any long time before it was oppoſed; and if it be ſaid it was not oppoſed at the beginning as ſoon as we heard of it in the world.

                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Wills,</hi> and others ſay, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Taylor</hi> did but perſonate an Anabaptiſt, he himſelf was for Infants Baptiſm, only he gave ſome weak Arguments to pleaſe the Baptiſts.</p>

                     <p>Its true Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> and others ſay ſo: But muſt it needs be as they ſuppoſe? Does it follow infallibly that the Doctor does prevaricate in his firſt book? is it not poſſible that he might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome meaſure of conviction, and ſo receded from the opinion he was once perſwaded of, and fell from that truth he ſo ſtrenuouſly contended for? The <hi>Galatians</hi> once received the Goſpel, but were ſo fooliſh as to fall from it. Beſides how frequently do we find divers of the fathers contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelves, and to build again the things that they deſtroyd? But we need not go ſo far: Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf is a famous inſtance: How often do's Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> contradict Mr. <hi>Baxter?</hi> and is it impoſſible Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> ſhould do ſo.</p>
                     <p>But you'l ſay he wrote another book, wherein he ſubmitted to the Judgment of the Church in the matter of Baptiſm. Its very like he did, and perhaps he was of the opinion of a Popiſh-prieſt who told me; <hi>There was indeed no Scripture for baptizing infants, but yet it ought to be done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church commanded it. He ſpake what many think.</hi>

                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:108740:51"/>But ſuppoſe the Doctor did, as you ſay, only perſonate an Anabaptiſt, and make uſe of ſome weak Arguments to pleaſe them. Then,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I wonder Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> or ſome other have not anſwered the Doctors weak Arguments all this while; for none that ever I heard of durſt enter the liſts with the Doctor in the matter: And to ſay, he did it by his contrary practiſe, is a frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, grant all to be true that you would have, and that the Doctor was not againſt baptizing infants (which we grant) nor Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> nor Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>But pray Sir what do you ſay to <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>If the firſt fruit be holy, the lump is holy; and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> From whence, we are told, this inference may be drawn, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> (conſidered as a root was holy, ſo
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108740:52"/>
were his children and ſo to be Circumciſed. So Believers being holy, their Children are ſo, and ſo to be Baptized.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bap.</speaker>
                     <p>There hath been enough ſaid to ſhew the fallacy of this conſequence: But that you may have no cauſe to complain, I ſhall ſpeak further to it; firſt, then you muſt know, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles purpoſe is to ſhew what <hi>Abraham</hi> was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, a holy root to his natural ſeed; but you will not ſay, he is ſo now; and that his children after the fleſh are ſtill holy, for they are cut off: And that he is not a holy root to the Infants of believing Gentiles, and that they are none of his branches, is abundantly proved: but if you ſay he is a holy root to believers, his ſpiritual ſeed, and they are holy; then we are agreed. For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apoſtle intends nothing elſe, but that as <hi>Abraham</hi> was a two-fold father, ſo he had a two-fold ſeed; ſo he is a two-fold root, and hath two ſorts of branches.</p>
                     <p>His firſt ſort of branches were holy with a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical ceremonial holyneſs; his ſecond ſort are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by believing as he did, and walking in his ſteps. But to purſue your conſequence a little further; that a believer (conſidered as a root) being holy, ſo his ſeed is holy, as of old it was with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then you muſt prove, that what was promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and what was his priviledge; juſt ſo it is with believers and their ſeed, and herein we expect plain Scripture proof, and not forced conſequences, and groundleſſe <hi>non ſequiturs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Secondly; If the natural ſeed of believers
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108740:52"/>
be holy, what kinde of holyneſſe is it? ſurely you do not mean moral holyneſſe which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſin, and that they have ſome inward qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, inherent habit, or principle of grace in them, more then unbelievers infants.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you do not mean negative holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for there is as much alſo of that in unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers infants as in yours. But,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, perhaps you mean a Covenant ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe; but what kinde of holyneſſe that is, we could never yet learn from you.</p>
                     <p>But if believers natural ſeed be holy, with a Covenant holyneſſe, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> were; then you muſt baptiſe all their childrens children in their ſeveral generations (as you have heard) whether their parents believe or not; as it was of old: <hi>Abrahams</hi> branches, yea all his bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were holy to the 3d, and 4th, yea the 10th. generation, and ſo muſt yours be, and ſo to be baptized; If the Grandfather or great-grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were, or further removed: he was the root and his poſterity are the branches, as well as his immediate infants, and ſo to be baptized. And if you ſay 'tis hard to finde whether their progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were believers ſo far remote; then 'tis but going a ſtep higher to <hi>Noah;</hi> and his faith will ſerve to Baptiſe the whole world, for <hi>Noah</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a believer is as well a root as <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that there is no kinde of holyneſſe in the natural ſeed of believers more then in the ſeed of unbelievers now under the Goſpel appears from theſe Arguments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If there be no perſons in the dayes of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108740:53"/>
Goſpel, to be accounted common or unclean, that is unholy (by nature) more then others; then there are no perſons to be accounted clean or holy (by nature) more then others: but the antecedent is true, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.28. <hi>God hath ſhewed me that I ſhould not call any man common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean:</hi> Ergo ſo is the conſequent.</p>
                     <p>But they that baptiſe Infants break the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to <hi>Peter,</hi> by counting the children of unbelievers common and unclean, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believers clean or holy.</p>
                     <p>But if the children of believers be holy with any kinde of holyneſſe above others: Then the children of unbelievers are unholy, with ſome kinde of unholineſſe more then others, and ſo to be accounted common and unclean.</p>
                     <p>But this is not ſo, for believers children <hi>are by nature children of wrath as well as others,</hi> as your ſelves confeſſe. Therefore, call nothing, no men, or ſpecies of men, common or unclean; for in every nation, he that fears God and works righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ſhall be accepted. Obſerve, divine acceptation comes in upon the account of actual and perſonal righteouſneſſe; no perſons nor their ſeed are now accepted for the holyneſſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (rather then others.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, If God be now no reſpecter of perſons, then there is no birth holyneſſe, and ſo no pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar priviledges belongs to believers natural ſeed by Gods appointment, more then to the ſeed of unbelievers: but the firſt is true <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſaith</hi> Peter, <hi>that God is no reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</hi> therefore, ſo is the latter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:108740:53"/>And that <hi>Peter</hi> meant this of birth holyneſſe, and natural priviledges is evident, becauſe he mentions this as the reſult of his viſion, where he was forbid to count any man common or unclean that is, more then others by nature, for God is no reſpecter of perſons. Its true all men are (by nature) common and unclean, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to moral cleaneſs, and Goſpel-holineſs: but no ſort of perſons are by nature clean, or holy, with any kinde of ceremonial, dedicative, or Covenant holyneſſe above others. But,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If there be a Covenant holyneſſe now, in the days of the Goſpel, flowing from the root to the branches; then God would rather have continued his Church in the poſterity of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (as of old); but he hath not done ſo; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no ſuch holyneſſe.</p>
                     <p>We read in the Second of the <hi>Acts.</hi> of 3000. <hi>baptized,</hi> and afterwards 5000. The greateſt part of which were believers, and the 7 Churches of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and (as you ſay) their children holy, with a Covenant holyneſſe: It is ſtrange then the Church was not continued in their poſterity: but it was not, for I ſuppoſe it is hard, if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to finde any one of their off-ſpring a member of any true Church in the world.</p>
                     <p>So the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> once a true Church: But you do not count the preſent Church ſo. why? they had believing parents, who were in Covenant, and their ſeed holy, yet God did not think fit to continue them a true Church any long time; But hath rather raiſed his Church out of the poſterity of unbelievers, and longer continued
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108740:54"/>
them. As in this nation; our progenitors were all Idolaters as the <hi>Brittains, Romans, Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans;</hi> The off-ſpring of ſome of whom we are: yet God hath continued his Church amongſt us a very conſiderable time. But if we boaſt of our Covenant holyneſs and birth priviledges, God may ſoon unchurch us, and raiſe up Church members out of ſtones, as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> told the Phariſees.</p>
                     <p n="4">4ly. There is no ſuch Covenant holyneſs under the Goſpel; becauſe that holyneſſe was a Typical Ceremonial holyneſſe, ſuch as was in beaſts, birds, Garments, oyl, the Altar, temple, yea in the whole land, and therefore called <hi>Emanuels</hi> land, and no other kind of holyneſs was in the ſeed: (let Pedo-Baptiſts ſay what they will) all which holyneſs is now aboliſhed and done away, and that appears thus.</p>
                     <p>If all uncleaneſs, and unholyneſs that was in ſome beaſts, birds, garments, oyl, Altars, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and men <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be now aboliſhed and done away; then all that cleaneſs and holyneſs that was in ſome beaſts, birds, garments, men <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is alſo aboliſhed, and done away: But the Antecedent is true <hi>Act.</hi> 10. as appears by <hi>Peters</hi> viſion; <hi>what God hath cleanſed, call not thou common or unclean,</hi> Ergo, ſo is the Conſequent.</p>
                     <p>And that there was an uncleaneſs, commoneſs, and unholyneſs in ſome men, as well as in beaſts, birds <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is evident: For it was not lawfull for a Jew to eat with him that was a Gentile. But now it is not ſo—<hi>If an unbeliever invite thee to a feaſt, if thou beeſt diſpoſed thou maieſt go.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:108740:54"/>And that all this Typical, dedicative denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native holyneſs is now aboliſhed appears further;</p>
                     <p>Becauſe that holyneſs that ſanctifyed the Jews land, City, Temple <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was Ceremonial only, and ſo aboliſhed; but that holyneſs which ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the ſeed was the ſame and no other, that ſanctifyed the land: therefore that holyneſs which ſanctifyed the ſeed is now aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>And if it be ſaid, that the holyneſs of the ſeed was not typical and Ceremonial, I prove it thus.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If all things under the law were but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and ſhaddow of good things to come; then the holyneſs of the ſeed was but a figure and ſhadow of good things to come; And ſo a type.</p>
                     <p>But the Antecedent is true, as we find in the 9th. <hi>and</hi> 10th. <hi>Chapters of the Hebrews;</hi> where all things under the law, all the priviledges of the old Covenant, all the perquiſites, dependances and appurtenances are called by ſuch names, as make them evidently appear to be Typical: as firſt they are called a figure <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9. <hi>which was a figure for the time then preſent.</hi> So <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy place made with hands, which are the figures of the true.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are called a patern <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.23. <hi>It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the paterns of the things in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They are called a ſhaddow <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>for the law having a ſhaddow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then the holyneſs of the ſeed being a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, an appurtenance, a priviledge of the law, or old Covenant was but a figure, patern, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108740:55"/>
and ſo Typical, and aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſay, if the holyneſs of the ſeed was a Type; what did it tipify? I anſwer:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt it typifyed the holyneſs of Chriſt who is called the <hi>holy child Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It was a type of the holyneſs of all <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſpiritual ſeed under the Goſpel, true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who are made holy by believing in Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>You have heard that the children of the unbelieving Jews was not ſo broken off from the Goſpel Church and covenant, and excluded with their parents unbelief, for if any of the children of the unbelieving Jews when they come to years (and children when at years are the ſeed of their parents, I hope) if I ſay, thoſe unbelieving Jews children do believe the promiſe is ſo made to them, that their parents unbelief cannot exclude them: but if when at years they do not believe, the promiſe is ſo made to believers and their ſeed, as that the parents faith, avails no further then to the ingrafting of himſelf; but he cannot at all entitle his natural ſeed, by his ſingle faith to the Goſpel Covenant or ordinances: For if it be otherwiſe, then the natural ſeed of thoſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Jews that were converted in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, have a birth priviledge, and are holy to this day, upon which they may claim admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

unto baptiſm as well as any; for they may plead as you do and ſay. Baptiſm is our right, we are the poſterity of thoſe believing Jews mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Act.</hi> 2. And <hi>if the firſt fruits be holy, ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By which you do no leſſe then grant what we contend for: that the faith of Anceſtors gives no right to their poſterity, to ſtand at all in the Goſpel Church and Covenant, but faith in the particular perſons. So that the Jews were broken off by unbelief; and thou and thine (O believing Gentile) muſt ſtand by faith. Yet not thy ſeed by thy faith, but thou, thy ſelf, by thine, and they by their own faith. Faith is that by which (thou ſtanding, and not thy ſeed) haſt right to ſtand in the Church, and not they. But if thy ſeed have faith, and thou haſt none, they have right to ſtand in the Church, and thou ſhalt be kept out. By which it appears, that the root may be holy (in a Goſpel ſence) and not the branches, and the branches may be holy, and not the root: ſo that your conſequence from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>if the root be holy, ſo are the branches,</hi> is falſe, and the whole Argument vain and empty.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſtill ſay (for nothing will ſatisfy ſome perſons) that the natural ſeed may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted holy, with a denominative, and dedicative holyneſſe: I anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That then the firſt born of every creature both of man &amp; beaſt is ſtill to be called and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

holy; for theſe were ſanctifyed and holy by dedication as well as the ſeed. <hi>Sanctify unto me all the firſt born of every creature both of man and beaſt,</hi> they are ſtill to be called and counted holy, for theſe were ſanctifyed, and holy by dedication as well as the ſeed.

                     <p n="2">2ly. If the ſeed be to be accounted holy with a dedicative holyneſſe, then you may as well count all things holy which were dedicated of old, as Temples, Altars, Tables, Garments, Tapers, Candleſticks, yea the very windows, Fonts, Rails, Copes, Surplices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this you deny, and have laboured hard both by pen and pulpit to make theſe holy things unholy: Though thoſe that own this dedicative holyneſſe ſtill have more to ſay for Infant-Baptiſm, then you who diſown it in all things elſe but in the natural ſeed.</p>
                     <p>But pray Sirs let me ask you a few queſtions.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. That it not lawful to aſſigne ſignifications to ſacramental Types (of our own heads) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant from the Scriptures.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. That in Baptiſm there is an Inviſible and cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial thing ſignified.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That though the blood of Chriſt is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and cauſe of all that grace and good we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in Baptiſm, yet it is not the thing ſignified by the water in Baptiſm; but the ſpirit cleanſing the ſoul from ſin in the work of Regeneration, according to <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That in the Baptiſm of Chriſt the miſtery of all our Baptiſm was viſibly acted.</p>

                     <p n="8">8. That the Fathers and primitive Church did not ſuppoſe any other correlative to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Baptiſm, but the ſpirit, though they did allude to Chriſts blood for illuſtration thereof.</p>

                     <p n="11">11. That the Analogy between waſhing with water in Baptiſm, and Regeneration, appears from the cuſtome of waſhing infants from the pollutions of the womb, when firſt born, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the practice of Jews and Gentiles.</p>

                     <p>From all which you ſee that baptiſm is not ſo much a ſign of purging our ſins by the bloud of Chriſt; though that concurs by way of merit and efficacy, but is not the thing there ſignifi'd or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: &amp; then to what purpoſe are infants baptized?</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee how this learned man (ere he was aware) hath ſpoyl'd Infant-Baptiſm: for if baptiſm be a ſymbol of regeneration (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it is) then unleſs you ſay (and that

from Scripture grounds) that your infants are regenerated, or ſeem ſo to be, baptiſm doth not at all belong to them.</p>
                     <p>And it will no ways help you to ſay, that the Baptiſts do baptize ſome perſons that are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated; for it is enough to warrant our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, if they profeſs ſo to be; and give us thoſe Scripture characters, <hi>i.e.</hi> actuall faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

                     <p>But pray Sir what think you of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural ſeed, what kind of Covenant was it?</p>

                     <speaker>Bap.</speaker>
                     <p>I confeſs there are various opinions about it; ſome ſay it was a Covenant of grace; others, a Covenant of works, others, a mixt Covenant: But ſurely that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his natural ſeed called the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, or Covenant of the Law was not the Covenant of Eternal life and ſalvation, which was made with all the elect in Chriſt upon the condition of faith: but a diſtinct Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of it ſelf concerning the worſhip and ſervice of God, and ſo may be called a Covenant of works, rather then a Covenant of grace; though there was alſo grace in it, as there was in all the Covenants that God ever made with men—yet we ſay, it was a diſtinct Covenant, and therefore called the old Covenant, and the Covenant of grace the new Covenant.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſay the Covenant of grace was the ſame in all ages under various adminiſtrations, we confeſs it, and ſay that the Covenant of grace was made to <hi>Adam</hi> after the fall, to the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:108740:62"/>
and to <hi>Abraham,</hi> before the Covenant of Circumciſion was mentioned, and is the ſame to us now. But, as ours, its called new, (or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed) yet it doth not follow, but this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion was a diſtinct Covenant ſtill; for <hi>Abraham</hi> and all believers in that age, were in the Covenant of grace before this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made; and would have been ſo, if the Covenant of Circumciſion had never been. And if you demand then, why the Covenant of works is called the old Covenant, and the Covenant of grace, the new?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I anſwer, becauſe of its priority, it being the firſt Covenant God made with man before the fall, as Proteſtant Divines ſay; that God made a Covenant of works with <hi>Adam,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect obedience, which he had then power to perform. And ſome think God renewed this Covenant of works after the fall, as appears by the ſacrifices that <hi>Adam, Abel,</hi> &amp;c. offered; and from that Scripture, if thou doſt well, ſhalt not thou be accepted; if not, ſin lyes at the door. And afterwards this Covenant of works or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant concerning worſhip is renewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his poſterity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is called the old Covenant in reſpect to its deteriority, it being a Covenant found fault with, as the Scripture ſaith.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In reſpect to its decaying and periſhing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it was not durable or laſting, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>that which decayeh and waxeth old is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to periſh, meaning this Covenant.</hi>—And the Covenant of grace is called the new Covenant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:108740:62"/>Firſt, becauſe of its meliority, or bitterneſs, it is more excellent, as the new heavens and the new earth that God will make will be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then the old.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In oppoſition to the old, as appears <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8. <hi>when God ſays he will make a new Covenant,</hi> he adds, <hi>not according to the Covenant, when I brought your fathers out of Egipt,</hi> which was by virtue of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. In reſpect to its perpetuity and duration, it is the everlaſting Covenant: the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural ſeed is vaniſhed and done away, but this remains, as the Apoſtle ſays: <hi>if that which was done away was glorious, how much more that which remains.</hi> That which was done away was the old Covenant, or Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his natural ſeed with all the priviledges of it. And that which remains is the new Covenant, or promiſe of eternal life made in <hi>Jeſus</hi> to all believers.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is called the new Covenant, as to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe renewed in a more Goſpel and glorious manner. So that we are indeed ſtill under the ſame Covenant of grace made with <hi>Adam</hi> and all the partriarchs: but not under the ſame Covenant of works made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural ſeed.</p>
                     <p>But further, that you may know what the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was, take the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a late learned Author</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The old Covenant (ſaith he) was a political Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with the Jews, as Princes compacts are with their people when they firſt ſet up Government: God promiſes them his protection, and that he would
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108740:63"/>
lead them to a fruitful land, overcome all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with the like bleſſings. And they promiſe they will be ruled by him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To this purpoſe did God in ſundry ways appear to them, To</hi> Moſes, <hi>to their elders, to them all in the cloud and fire, and then cauſes a Tabernacle to be made for him; which was a keeping houſe amongſt them, where the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and offerings were his proviſions, and the Prieſts his ſervants that lived on him. And unto that Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and Ark, might they repair for counſel and Judgment. This people then, being under a</hi> Theocracy, <hi>which</hi> Samuel <hi>does in two places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſignify (at leaſt unto the time of</hi> Saul) <hi>ſo that the Church and Common-wealth of the Jews were but one. It is no wonder if Religion be made their laws and ſo required of them together with other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Ordinances and ſtatutes for their happineſſe and publick peace as a nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And though in their ceremonial offerings and Prieſts appointmens there was a remembrance ſtill of ſin; yet had they Types of Chriſt, of remedying mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and of the glory to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Their ſacrifices as I have ſaid ſerve to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of this houſe, the Tabernacle and Temple which he was pleaſed to keep up amongst them for a time, God indeed making uſe of theſe, for Types and repreſentations of other things, that is to ſay ſpiritual, and ſo the law being a Paedagogy under a temporal diſpenſation, leading men to Chriſt. So far my Author.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But God hath quite pulled down this houſe, brake up houſe-keeping as we ſay, and turned the ſervants, Infants and all out of doors <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108740:63"/>
The natural branches are broken off—and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. <hi>That which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vaniſh.</hi> And ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>if that which was done away was glorious &amp;c.</hi> what was that but this old houſe with all the priviledges of it?</p>
                     <p>But now God hath built him a new houſe into which he hath admitted none as his houſhold ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants but believers or ſuch as profeſs ſo to be. And theſe two houſes are mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. where one is called <hi>Moſes</hi> his houſe, and the other <hi>Chriſts</hi> houſe: <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>was faithful in all his houſe. For this man was accounted worthy of more honour then</hi> Moſes; <hi>in as much as he that hath buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the houſe, hath more honour, then the houſe.</hi> Moſes <hi>was faithful as a ſervant but Chriſt as a ſon over his own houſe, whoſe houſe are we, if we hold faſt the confidence</hi> &amp;c. where the ſervants are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deſcribed, they are belivers, not infants, hence they are alſo called <hi>living ſtones,</hi> and <hi>a ſpiritual houſe</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.</p>
                     <p>And that none but ſuch are of this houſhold ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that Chriſt the great Maſter of this houſe is compared to a king travelling into a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who called his ſervants, (all his ſervants) and delivered unto them his goods, that is, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Talents to improve Math.</hi> 25.14, 15. which cannot be ſuppoſed to be delivered to infants while they want the uſe of reaſon; for theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents are preſently to be <hi>improv'd and laid out,</hi> not laid up.</p>
                     <p>So again <hi>Chriſt is compared to a houſe-keeper who made a great ſupper, and invited his gueſts,</hi> but they were not infants, becauſe the firſt that were
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108740:64"/>
invited made excuſes. The next are compeld to come in, which ſuppoſes an unwillingneſs in the parties, and that they were perſons capable to conſent or deny. The ſumme of all is, that the old houſe the Jewiſh Church, with all the appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and priviledges of it, is pulled down, and a new one built, into which infants are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauſe not invited nor appointed by any law. They were of the houſhold of old, but it was by a poſitive law; ſhew us the like now, or you ſay nothing. Sure I am there is no inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that makes infants now fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God: Neither are they ſo to be accounted till they believe, and are able to do ſervice in the houſe.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſay, that amongſt men, infants are counted of the houſhold though they can do no ſervice; I anſwer; that compariſon does not run upon four feet, it doth not follow, that, becauſe we count our infants of our family, therefore they are to be accounted members of Gods family, the Goſpel Church, unleſs God by any inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had made them ſo. The houſhold of God is called the houſhold of faith; do good unto all, eſpecially the houſhold of faith; or a houſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of believers: now, unleſs you prove your infants to be believers they are not of this houſe: For all the ſervants here muſt be believers either really, or Hiſtorically and profeſſedly, which infants cannot be. And it will not help you to ſay the Church was (or may be) called the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhould of faith ſynecdochically, from the greateſt part; for it is evident all the materialls of the firſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108740:64"/>
Churches were adult perſons, and profeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as appears by the narrative we have in the Acts of the Apoſtles, the direction of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, and divers Scriptures. Beſides it may ſo happen that the infants may be the greateſt part of a Congregation, and then where is your hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of faith?</p>

It was no part of the typical adminiſtration, but a moral inſtitution of God even from the beginning of the world.

But let us examine this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
                     <p>He ſaith, <hi>that Infant Church-memberſhip did take place as an ordinance of God, before Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion &amp;c.</hi> But where is that ordinance? why are
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108740:65"/>
we not directed to ſome place of Scripture where we may find it? Did God make Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> of his Cabinet Councel, and reveal it to him, and no body elſe? Or in what Ancient father did he find it? Did any one ever ſay ſo before him?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>that it was no part of the typical Adminiſtration, but a moral inſtitution of God</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer; there hath been enough ſaid to prove the fallacy and novelty of this poſition. Therefore I referr you to what hath been written. But he ſaith, <hi>it is a moral inſtitution.</hi>—We ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, where we ſhall find that inſtitution, or elſe wee'l ſay, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is wiſe above what is written.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He ſaith <hi>God ever made a diſtinction between the ſeed of the faithful, and the ſeed of the wicked.</hi> —But what diſtinction? Did God ſingle them out, and ſeparate them by any viſible ſign or character before the law of Circumciſion? It is evidently known he did not.—Or did God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them by his providential care of them, or proviſion for them more then others? The Scripture is ſilent as to this alſo.—Or did God love them with a ſaving love more then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of unbelievers? This ſeems to be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe of his next words—<hi>as viſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to ſeveral kingdoms, of God, and Satan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But is it ſo? Did all the children of believers from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> belong to the kingdom of God? and all the children of unbelievers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the kingdom of the Devil?

                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt and chief end of Baptiſm is to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiating ſign and ſeal of Gods Covenant, and favour to us in Chriſt, and not to give an entrance or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Church. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs perſons are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted members of the Church, they are not to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: For Baptiſm in its own nature is the ſeal of our being already ingrafted into Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently into the Church. For which he Quotes Dr. Ames.</hi> And pag. 45. <hi>We deny</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm doth give Formality, or make a man a member of a viſible Church, though that Orthodox Divines have frequently termed Baptiſm, the Sacrament of our initiation into the Church, and have aſcribed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108740:66"/>
our admiſſion or entrance into it, thereunto pag.</hi> 46. To which I anſwer.</p>

                     <p>It ſeems then, that Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> is wiſer then his orthodox Divines.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If Baptiſm be a ſign of our being already in Chriſt, and ſo members of the Church before they are Baptized; Then I hope our children may be in Chriſt, &amp; reputed members of the Church, though they are not Baptized. And then what need is there of theſe clamours againſt the Baptiſts for keeping their children out of the Church, and (in as much as in them lyes) hindring their ſalvation, when they are in Chriſt, and members of his Church before Baptiſm, by vertue of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faith? And if you ſay, <hi>we deny them a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that is due to them;</hi> We ſay, we do not: Our great deſire is they ſhould be Baptized, and do inſtruct them in the principles of Chriſtianity for that end; that as ſoon as they are capable to improve the priviledge they may have it. And as for the Circumſtance of time your ſelves ſay, that is not materal, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>her it be done on the 8th. 10th. or 20th. day, and why may not the Baptiſts deferr it to the 20th. year, there being as much warrant in Scriptures for the one as for the other, though indeed no poſitive rule for either, only the time of believing is the moſt certain time aſſigned for Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But thirdly Mr <hi>Wills</hi> ſpoiles all he has ſaid, and contradicts himſelf <hi>pag.</hi> 229. where he ſaith, <hi>that as Circumciſion gave entrance into the Church of the Jews, ſo are believers and their ſeed by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm entred into the Goſpel Church.</hi> And it will not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108740:67"/>
help him to ſay, <hi>that Infants by vertue of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faith are only members of the univerſal viſible Church</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>before Baptiſm, but not of any particular Church:</hi> For he himſelf ſaith, <hi>that he that is a member of the univerſal Church, may at any time claim his priviledge in any particular Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What confuſion is here! ſometimes Baptiſm gives not admittance into the Church, but they are members of the Church before as pag. 27, 28. And then again that believers and their ſeed are by Baptiſm admitted into particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; at another place that Baptiſm only admits them into the Univerſal viſible Church. I think <hi>Mr Wills</hi> has little hopes to reconcile the <hi>Baptiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> and the <hi>Poedo-Baptiſts,</hi> ſeeing he is not reconciled to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But as to the principle you mention <hi>that perſons may be Church members before they are Baptized:</hi> Its true Mr <hi>Wills</hi> makes a great ſtir againſt Mr <hi>Paul</hi> and others, whom he calls rigid Anabaptiſts becauſe they cannot ſee any ground to admit perſons to the ſupper before Baptiſm. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labours hard to prove that which he confeſſes Orthodox divines are againſt, yet he would be ſingular, and force this novelty upon the world, which himſelf &amp; but few others have of late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for. But what would the man have? ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Turk or a Jew ſhould be converted, would he admit them to the ſupper before Baptiſm? and ſo own them Church members, whether ever they were baptiſed or not? God ſtrictly commanded of old, that no uncircumciſed perſon ſhould eate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108740:67"/>
the paſſeover: And what rule have you that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized perſons ſhould be admitted to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? But he tells us this is the opinion only of ſome rigid <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> and thinks there to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf. Indeed Mr <hi>Ieſsey,</hi> and ſome other good men were of that opinion, that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might be admitted to the ſupper who were not yet convinced, but that their Infant-Baptiſm was true Baptiſm. But why muſt all others be counted rigid Anabaptiſts becauſe they cannot ſee with other mens eyes? But this is one of the many ſcurrilous reflections in Mr <hi>Wills</hi>'s Book, to ſupply the ſcarcity of Argument. I could tell him of ſome rigid <hi>Independents,</hi> and rigid <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> too, who are ſo far from having Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Baptiſts, that they would pluck up ſuch Tares (ſo they account them) out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <speaker>Paedo.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir I thank you for this diſcourſe and the pains you have taken in order to my ſatisfaction. I confeſſe I finde my ſelf more convinc'd then I was; and do think you are of the ſureſt ſide, it being moſt certain that believers were and ought to be baptized; but whether any Infants were or ought, is very uncertain. And ſurely it is ſafeſt (in controverted matters) to adhere to that ſide that is moſt certain. Beſides there are two things that I am much ſtumbled at.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt, is the great ignorance of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Paedo-baptiſt congregations in this matter: Not one amongſt many, is able to prove Infant-Baptiſm, or to anſwer your Arguments, but are forced to referr the matter to their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: whereas, hardly any amongſt you, but are able to give a ſatisfactory reaſon of their hope in this thing; and can preſently prove believers Baptiſm from Scripture precept and example. As of old if a heathen had demanded of any Jew the reaſon and Ground of his circumciſion, he could preſently turn to the 17th. <hi>of Geneſis,</hi> and there prove it from a poſitive command of God. But if a heathen ſhould ask us, why we baptize our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, we that are but ordinary perſons know not how to ſatisfy him; we cannot direct him to any Scripture where it is written: Which is ſtrange, that a Goſpel ordinance ſhould be left ſo dark and intricate, and the ordinance of circumciſion under the law, be ſo plain and obvious that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry child of any reaſon could preſently ſhew the ground of it. This makes me ſuſpect the truth of it; becauſe the Apoſtle ſays he uſed great
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108740:68"/>
plaineſſe of ſpeech, and not as <hi>Moſes</hi> who put a vail upon his face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſurely Goſpel Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould be ſo plain, eſpecially as to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that he that runs may read them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. The next thing that offends me is the great difference amongſt Miniſters, about the ground of Infant-Baptiſm, as if they knew not where to faſten it, what baſis to build it upon, ſome (as Mr <hi>Danvers</hi> obſerves) draw it from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of grace, and the neceſſity of Baptiſm to ſalvation, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>Some from the faith of the Church; ſome from a ſuppoſed ſeminal faith that may be in the child.</p>
                     <p>Some from the faith of the parents; others from the faith of the ſureties; ſome (if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate parents be not Godly) think the faith of the Grand-father, or great-Grand-father may ſerve.</p>
                     <p>Some upon the account of Covenant holyneſſe, or the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; others, if both, or one of the parents be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a gathered Church. Some think they are born members of the viſible Church by vertue of their parents faith, and ſo may be baptized.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this there is a great difference about baptizing of baſtards: ſome think if the father repent, the child may be baptized; others think otherwiſe, becauſe a Baſtard was not to enter into the Congregation to the 10th. generation; and ſo about the children of excommunicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which makes us fear that we are out of the way, and our leaders have cauſed us to err ſeeing they cannot agree, upon what ground
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108740:69"/>
to baptiſe our Infants. Its true Mr <hi>Wills</hi> pretends to anſwer this, but very weakly: he tells us the baptiſts differ amongſt themſelves about the ground of their practiſe; but ſure I am there is no ſuch material difference as there's amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>You are all agreed that the profeſſion of faith and Repentance is the ground of Baptiſm, and if ſome deſire a larger confeſſion then others, and ſignes of grace, I think it is no great error, but rather an evidence of zeal to God, and good to the parties ſoul. But what is this to thoſe materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and eſſential differences before mentioned?</p>
                     <p>Theſe things will put me upon further ſearch, and I hope what you have ſaid will be of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to me. In the mean time I take leave and bid you farewell.</p>

                  <p>OUr Opponents cry out for Unity, and would fain lay the cauſe of that hateful Word <hi>[Diviſion]</hi> at our doors, and methinks they might well forbear making ſuch a noiſe, unleſs they aſſign us what kind of the ſeveral ſorts of Unity they mean; and propound ſome <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> to make the ſame practicable. And I may ſay, What Unity? ſo long as that imperious, reflecting, and condemning Spirit remains in them. Some forbidding of their Members to hear our Miniſters, or to read their Books; rather allowing them liberty to joyn with the Multitude, than to appear in our Societies. But if I may ſpell out their meaning, it ſeems to be this.</p>
                  <p>That all the <hi>Anti-paedo-Baptiſts</hi> ſhould break up their Societies, and joyn with them, and own their Miniſters for their Paſtors, ſuffer them quietly to Baptize Infants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo ſin againſt their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; it appearing to them to be groſs Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Prophanation of an Ordinance. But ſhould they tell you, they judge there is as good, if not better grounds that you ſhould joyn with them, and own the Baptiſm of Believers (the only Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Baptiſm) I know not where a Moderator or Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire would be found to determine this matter. And how can Two walk together, except they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108740:70"/>So that the Unity of the Verity is not ſurely the thing they hope for; for though it be greatly deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet very hard to obtain, becauſe one man thinks this to be truth, and another that, according to the ſeveral Lights they have received. And if it be the Unity of Authority they intend, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould ſet down ſome Uniform practice, and command all manner of perſons to comply thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; this looks like divers of them. But were there ſuch a practice attempted and yielded unto, it might make many Hypocrites in the higheſt degree of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie; but be far from that ſpiritual Unity they talk of.</p>
                  <p>Nor can an Unity of perſwaſion be hoped for, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both in Preſs and Pulpit, and other wayes, both Parties have endeavoured to perſwade one another, but to little or no Effect.</p>
                  <p>Nor can it be an Unity of Neceſſity, now in Times of common danger; for Tyes of neceſſity u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually bind no longer than one Side hath need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                  <p>Nor can any Unity of Covenant do it, for that is forced in many places; and <hi>I</hi> fear too many ſay, as the Heathen did, <hi>Juravi Lingua, mentem injuratam gero, I</hi> ſwore with my tongue, but not with my heart.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then we cannot find out what kind of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is intended, it is beſt for both parties to continue in the Societies to whom they belong, till God ſhall convince them otherwiſe, provided they do not put out their light, and ſin againſt their Conſciences, nor neglect any opportunity, better to inform their Judgments.</p>
                  <p>But there is one kind of Unity yet behind, and that
<pb facs="tcp:108740:70"/>
is the unity of Affections; and if you mean this, I am willing to joyn iſſue with you, and in this I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but blame the whole generation of Profeſſors, who are greatly faulty in this matter.</p>
                  <p>For my own part, I know the ſhadows of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Evening are upon me, and am every day wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon the Banks of Eternity, and do hope er'e long to enter into thoſe ſacred Manſions, where all the Saints are of one mind, where we ſhall poſſeſs, not diſpute our Unity; wherefore I ſhall leave my Teſtimony for the unity of Charity and Affection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all that are Godly, though of different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions; and ſhall enforee it from theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From the work of Regeneration,</hi> which ſome of all differing Profeſſors can experience. Indeed while in a ſtate of unregeneration, nothing is to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but Jars and Contentions, for all Diviſion comes from ſin, <hi>Scelera diſſident.</hi> It is ſo in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, one affection ſtruggles in the Soul for maſtery; Ambition fights with malice, and Pride with Covetouſneſs: the head plots againſt the heart, and the heart ſwells againſt the head. Reaſon and Appetite, Will and Paſſion, Soul and Body ſet the whole frame of Nature into a continual Combuſtion, one Faculty moves contrary to the Government or Attraction of another, and ſo as in a confluence of contrary Streams and Winds, the World is turned into a maze of Contentions.</p>
                  <p>But when once we become Chriſtians, and are made conformable to Chriſt, it preſently maketh of two one; and ſo worketh peace: It ſlayeth the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and war in the Members of Chriſt againſt one another; it reduceth to that primitive harmony, and
<pb facs="tcp:108740:71"/>
uniform Spirituality. Yea Converſion layes an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon Chriſtians to love one another: If we love him that Begat, we cannot but love him that is Begotten.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe all things elſe agree:</hi> The beams of the Sun, though divided and diſtinct from one another, have yet an unity in the ſame nature of light, becauſe all partake of one Native and Original ſplendor. The limbs of a Tree, though all ſeveral, and ſpreading di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wayes, yet have an unity in the ſame Fruit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all are incorporated into one Stock and Root. The ſtreams of a River, though running divers wayes, do yet all agree in the unity of ſweetneſs and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe all iſſuing from the ſame pure Fountain. Why then ſhould not Chriſtians, though of different Perſwaſions, agree in the unity of Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe by Diviſion, Diſcord, and Rebellion the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate Angels loſt their Heavenly Habitation, and are for ever plunged into eaſeleſs and remedileſs Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The Devil was Created an Angel of Light, and ſtood a while in Unity and Harmony until he began to Jar, and enter into Diviſion, and to chuſe to be an abſolute Nature of himſelf; and would ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and break himſelf off from Unity, by which he became viler than the vileſt of Gods Creatures: And ſo it is poſſible, for perſons by leaving the principles of Harmony, Unity, and Love, to fall from the moſt glorious ſtate of profeſſion, into endleſs miſery and perdition.</p>
                  <p>The excellency of the unity of Charity appears fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from thoſe <hi>Notae quietis,</hi> or letters of reſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imprinted upon the whole Series of Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for if we ſurvey the particulars of this ſtately
<pb facs="tcp:108740:71"/>
Fabrick, we ſhall find the image of peace and love impreſſed and imprinted, as the Conſervatory prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of their Natures, ſtampt at firſt by the Divine Creator, when out (of a confuſed Chaos) it pleaſed the Eternal parent, or Radical principle of all things (being not willing that ſo large a ſpace ſhould be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally bereft of his gracious influence, or his bounty any longer fruſtrated, from Communicating Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſo many millions of Creatures as might act upon this Stage) to effect this Creation; for when by his powerful Word he applyed himſelf to Create this ſenſible World, out of ſo great diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; he effects it with ſo much ſymmetry and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, that Nature ſeems to loſe it ſelf in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſuch a Being. And as the Crown and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all doth ſo imprint peace and unity in it, that to attempt the Extirpation of theſe from the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe, were to endeavour the reduction of this ſtately Engine into its Original Chaos and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Beſides we find when the great Creator began to make a diviſion in this ſenſible World, it was only of ſuch things as were directly contrary and oppoſite to one another, as light and darkneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.4. <hi>And God divided the light from the darkneſs, and God ſaw that it was good;</hi> ſhewing us that it was never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there ſhould be any diviſion in the World, but between light and darkneſs; things directly and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially contrary.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the next Diviſion (which was the Work of the Second day) that was between the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the Waters, things of the ſame kind and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that work had no Bleſſing annexed to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the firſt breach of Unity; which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

ſome ſay is branded with infamy, <hi>Numerus Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius infamoſus eſt, quia primus auſus eſt diſcedere ab unitate,</hi> becauſe it was the firſt that durſt depart from unity. And though there be a kind of war between the Elements, yet ſome are of Opinion, that it is more imaginary than real; for we find ſometimes they will forget their Natural ſtations and properties, and (to avoid <hi>vacuum</hi>) will mutually paſs into the room of one another; yea, not only lovingly to mix, but to dwell with one another peaceably; as fire and water will ſometime dwell together; as we ſee in Tempeſts Of Thunder, Rain, and Hail; and alſo in Spirit of Wine, and other things.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially things of the ſame Tribe and Kind do moſt earneſtly affect one another (from an Innate principle of Union) as Water and Salt do mutually embrace each other.</p>
                  <p>And as the harmonious aſſent of things amongſt themſelves is admirable, ſo the Heavens with the Lower Region is no leſs wonderful; for in the whole frame of Nature, there is ſuch an admirable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that all the deſign is to maintain a Friendly U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and concatenation between themſelves; deſiring only to gratifie the Supream Ruler, and benefit each other: Nature ordering and diſpoſing all things to be carryed about in a moſt uniform Circulation.</p>
                  <p>And now is it not ſtrange, when the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth, as it were, ſtudy peace and amity, man ſhould continue and practice the contrary? And thoſe that ſhould be lead by the Spirit into Unity and Love, ſhould be ſent to the meaneſt Creatures to learn their Leſſons of peace and concord?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, We may conſider the Evils that Diſcord brings upon the Outward man;</hi> it was diſcord, diviſion,
<pb facs="tcp:108740:72"/>
and contention that brought, and ſtill brings thoſe Bodily maladies, ſickneſſes, aches, paines, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the Bodies of Men; and at laſt death it ſelf. For how came thoſe things into the World, but from the rebellious ſtrivings and contentions of the Body with the Soul: For as long as <hi>Adams</hi> mind was ſubject unto God, and ſtood in Harmony and Union with him, the inferior powers of the Soul were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto Reaſon, and the Body unto the Soul, and this Union prevents all infirmities and ſickneſſes; but he no ſooner Rebels againſt God, and breaks himſelf off from this Union, and enters into Diviſion, but he preſently finds Contention raging within him; for now thoſe inferior powers, will be no longer ſubject unto Reaſon; but the rebellious pride of the Carnal appetite is ſuch, that the Body ceaſeth to be any longer ſubject to the Soul; upon which ſtrivings and contentions enter, and from thence all manner of Diſeaſes and Diſtempers upon the Body: for death, and all corporeal infirmities are but the immediate effects of the diſobedience of the Body to the Soul; and man is entred into Contrariety, not only with himſelf, but others alſo, and hath a property and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Contradiction, whereby he oppoſes, quarrels, divides from, and contends with others. And is ſo far departed from the unity and harmonious agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhould be in the minds of men, eſpecially Chriſtians, that now there ariſeth paſſion, anger, and envy; which ſo diſturbs, torments, and diſquiets the mind (becauſe others are not like us) that from thence follow in a great meaſure, diſeaſes, infirmities, and bodily diſtempers; becauſe the Soul departs from Harmony, and is in continual vexation and anxiety; ſo that the Humors of the Body are diſquieted, and
<pb facs="tcp:108740:73"/>
the radical moiſture deſtroyed. Perſons that are of a Cholerick Temper, are more ſubject to Diſeaſes, than thoſe of a more quiet and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rene diſpoſition; their paſſion inflames the inward parts, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the whole frame of Nature, and envious men are ſubject to Conſumptive diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Invidus alterius rebus macreſcit Opimis</hi>) becauſe his mind is full of diſſatisfaction and diſquietneſs, being departed from Unity. And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The bloody-minded man ſhall not live out half his dayes:</hi> And we know thoſe <hi>Anchorets</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> that have reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the World into Dens and Caves of the Earth, that they might live a contemplative Life, and be free from all manner of diſcord, contention, and diviſion, have lived to an exceeding Old Age, and free from thoſe diſtempers, and Bodily Infirmities that others meet with; the unity, agreement, and harmony of their minds much conducing to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health. So it's ſaid of <hi>Moſes, that he was an hundred and twenty years old when he dyed; his Eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated,</hi> Deut. 34.7. we know of what quiet, ſerene, and meek Spirit he was of, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Now the man</hi> Moſes <hi>was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the Earth;</hi> ſo that the quietneſs of his mind did very much contribute to the ſanity of his Body. And if Men and Women would more follow the Counſel of the Phyſitian of their Souls, who bids us live in peace, unity, and love; they would not (perhaps) ſo often want a Phyſitian for their Bodies.</p>

                  <p>Queſt. <hi>WEre not the Children of Believers Church-Members before</hi> Abraham's <hi>time?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, the Scripture makes no mention of any ſuch thing; neither was there any viſible ſign or mark appointed by God to diſtinguiſh them from the Children of Unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt. Was there no ſucceſſive conveyance of Grace from believing Parents to their Children?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, becauſe the Children of Believers prov'd as wicked as others; inſomuch as all fleſh had corrupted its wayes, and God brought the flood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World of Ungodly.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>What then became of the Children that Dyed from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Abraham?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe that belonged to the Election of Grace were Saved, though in no outward Covenant, nor ſigned by any Viſible Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Why then did God make a Covenant with</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>and his Seed, and diſtinguiſh them from all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he had a deſign that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come of his Loins, and therefore his Males only are commanded to be Circumciſed, to ſignifie that Chriſt ſhould be a Man-child, and ſhould ſhed his Blood for the ſins of Believers.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To diſtinguiſh them from other Nations, with whom they were not to Marry, leſt the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſhould be Interrupted, and ſo the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> not come of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Loynes.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>What advantage had they of Circumciſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were counted the Viſible people of God for a time, had the Laws of God committed to them, and the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and divers Earthly Bleſſings beſtowed upon them.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But had any other People any right to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Salvation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea; It being evident that God had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his people amongſt the Gentiles who belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Election of Grace, as <hi>Job,</hi> and his Three Friends, and others, which appears by <hi>Bildad's</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Ancients, <hi>Job</hi> 8.8, 10. <hi>For enquire I pray thee of the Former Age, and prepare thy ſelf to the ſearch of their Fathers;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>ſhall not they teach thee, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But how came it to paſs that the Jews became the People of God, and not others?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By vertue of a Grant from God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who freely made a promiſe to be a God to him, and his Seed after him.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Was this promiſe made to</hi> Abraham <hi>becauſe he was better than others, or before, or after he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, It was freely of Grace, for God ſound him an Idolater, and theſe Promiſes were made to him before he Believed; for we hear nothing of his Faith till <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108740:74"/>Queſt. <hi>Were his Children then Partakers of thoſe Priviledges, meerly by being deſcended from his Loynes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea; we find no other Reaſon rendred.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But we hear</hi> Abraham <hi>was a Believer, and received the ſign of Circumciſion as a token of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs he had by Faith: Is it neceſſary then that his Children have the like Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true <hi>Abraham</hi> Believed after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and was Circumciſed; but it was not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that his Children ſhould Believe in order to Circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But as</hi> Abraham <hi>was a Believer before his Children had a right to Circumciſion, ſo ſhould it not be known that every Father in</hi> Iſrael <hi>were a Believer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Child were admitted to Circumciſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: for all were required to Circumciſe their Children, whether the Parent Believed, or not.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Were none to be Circumciſed but thoſe that Deſcended from</hi> Abraham?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, all that were born in his Houſe, or bought with money.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But was it not required that thoſe Servants in</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Houſe ſhould profeſs Faith before they and their Children were Circumciſed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, It was not commanded to be done upon any condition of Faith, in the Parent or Child that was a Servant.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Were</hi> Abrahams <hi>Children Circumciſed by vertue of any right they had to the Covenant of Grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; for ſome of <hi>Noah's</hi> Children, &amp;c. had a Right to the Covenant of Grace, yet not Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed;
<pb facs="tcp:108740:75"/>
and <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael &amp;c.</hi> had no right to the Covenant of Grace, and yet Circumciſed,</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Were not Infants Church-Members in</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham<hi>'s time?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea; the Church and the Common-wealth being all one, they muſt needs be Members.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>When did their Memberſhip ceaſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> When Chriſt came and had ſuffered; when the Prieſthood was changed, when the Law of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ceaſed, when the natural branches were broken off, the old Houſe removed, and a new one built.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Are not the Infants of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>Church-members now in the dayes of the Goſpel?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. No, there being no Inſtitution or Command for it; beſides the Church and the Common-wealth are now divided, and God hath not taken in any one Nation, or ſort of people diſtinct from others to be his Church; but Believers only out of every Kindred, Tongue, and Nation.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Have not then the Infants of Believing</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles <hi>leſs priviledg than the</hi> Jews <hi>had?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw</hi> No; For Circumciſion had been no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg nor duty, had there been no Inſtitution for it: Neither is Baptiſm a priviledge or duty to any, but to thoſe to whom it is Commanded. But the priviledges of the Children of Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> are greater than the <hi>Jews;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> being come, which is the ſum and ſubſtance of all their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, of Circumciſion, of Memberſhip, and all their Typical Ordinances: So that as ſoon as Infants are capable of Underſtanding, they are to be brought up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Anti-Type of all their Types; who is
<pb facs="tcp:108740:75"/>
to be made known unto them, as being already come, and hath ſuffered for all that Believe in him. Whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> could but inform their Children, that Chriſt would come, and ſuffer for the ſins of men.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Have not thoſe that had a right to the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Old Covenant, a right to the priviledges of the new, by vertue of their former right?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; for then the <hi>Jews</hi> had a right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm without any profeſſion of Faith and Repentance. Beſides the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb,</hi> 13.10. <hi>We have an Altar whereof they have no right to eat that ſerve the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle:</hi> And ſo we ſay, we have a Baptiſm, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have no right to, as they had to Circumciſion; becauſe there is no Inſtitution for it.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But may not the Children of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be counted</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; For <hi>Abraham</hi> hath but two Seeds, the natural <hi>Jew,</hi> and profeſſed Believers amongſt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> a third Seed cannot be aſſigned him.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But may not Infants be counted Chriſts Seed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; for Chriſt left no natural Iſſue, (who ſhall declare his Generation) ſhewing us that he did not intend to build his Church of Natural Children (as of Old) not of dead, but of living Stones. Beſides Believers Children are Children of Wrath by nature as well as others, and therefore not to be accounted Chriſts Seed, or to be Baptized, while ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Is not Baptiſm an Ordinance of the New Teſtament, and muſt it not be proved by a New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Inſtitution?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108740:76"/>Queſt. <hi>Where is your Inſtitution then for Infant Baptiſm?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is urged to be <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. I will be a God to thee and to thy Seed.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Is there any thing concerning Baptiſm in this Scripture?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, But we draw this Conſequence, that as God promiſed to be God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed; ſo he will be a God to every Believer and his Seed.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Did God in theſe words promiſe to ſave</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>and all his Natural Seed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, But the meaning is, that he and his Seed ſhould be the Viſible Church; and enjoy the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which no other people ſhould.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>And does this promiſe belong to believing</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and their natural Seed, that they only ſhall be the viſible Church of God, and their Children only enjoy the Ordinances of God ſucceſſively from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; for then theſe Abſurdities would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God has not been as good as his promiſe, for the Church has not been continued in the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Believers ſince Chriſts time, but often paſſed out of their Race into the Poſterity of Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That then, ſince the firſt promulgation of the Goſpel, there is no ſuch need of Preaching to the Heathen, in as much as theſe being not of the Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Believers, they are not to be of the Viſible Church, nor enjoy the Ordinances: So that it is a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy to hold that God hath promiſed to be a God to Believers and their Natural Seed, as he did to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108740:76"/>
and his Seed; to continue his Church only in the Poſterity of them that firſt received the Goſpel. But he is ſtill gathering his Church out of the poſterity of Unbelievers, and therefore before the end of the World the Angel is ſaid to Preach the Everlaſting Goſpel to every Nation, Kindred, and Tongue, and People, who are not of the poſterity of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Why do the Paedo-baptiſts Baptize their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe both, or one of the Parents, are in the Covenant of Grace.</p>

                  <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
                  <p>SOon after I had finiſhed this Treatiſe, Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi> Book came to my Hands: And in regard of his long ſilence, ſome great matter was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: but after my peruſal of it, I find no News at all. The firſt part of his Book (even 180 pages) is nothing elſe but a Collection of certain Old Letters that paſt between him and Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> long ſince: In which, whether he hath dealt Candidly with Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> I know not, the contrary is juſtly feared; if the Reader take notice of thoſe Pieces, Scrips, and Parcels of Letters from Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> but his own Written at large.</p>
                  <p>As to the matter contained in thoſe Letters, I find it to be nothing but what hath been Anſwered long ſince; and it would amount to no other than Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, and Tautology to Anſwer over again. The tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Verdict I can give of it, is, <hi>that it is</hi> (like moſt of his other Controverſies) <hi>a lump of Logical Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, a Syſtem of Syllogiſtical Vanity, wherein the Man manages his War like ſome Freſh man that is newly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculated into the Faculty of Logicking in Mood and Figure, that delights to hear himſelf Syllogize out every Syllable; and ſo comes out with a huge heap of Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticals, arguing at a vaſt difference from the buſineſs of</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>and ſometimetimes</hi> Ex Suppoſitis non Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponendis <hi>too, as if he ſhould fetch Infant baptiſm from far, ſince 'tis ſo dark in Scripture</hi> (as he has confeſſed it is) <hi>that he cannot have it nigh at hand; proving in a
<pb facs="tcp:108740:77"/>
great Circumference of Conſequence upon Conſequence, Syllogiſm upon Syllogiſm; thus, if this, then that; if this, then that; but this, therefore that; when very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten neither this, nor that, is true: So that like a Tree, his Book runs out into ſo many ſmaller Boughs, and Twigs, and layes it ſelf out at large into ſuch a train of Trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, ſo many littles to the purpoſe; that he will find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf great ſtore of ſmall buſineſs that ſhall throw away ſo much of his precious time to read his Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing I take notice of in his Book is his Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his Collections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the Reader will find ſo much Gall and Vinegar, ſuch a proud, auſtere, magiſterial Spirit; ſuch ſcurrilous, unchriſtian Language, that it makes me amaſed, and to queſtion, whether this be Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> or his Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Mr. <hi>Wills.</hi> But it ſeems they are both agreed in their unſavory Dialect. Is this the man that Wrote ſo much for Love and Unity? and would make the World believe that he is made up of nothing but Charity? Suppoſe Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſhould be miſtaken in ſome of his Collections; had it nbt been better to have ſhewed him his miſtakes in a Mild, Chriſtian, and Brotherly way? And if you ſay <hi>the offence was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and therefore deſerved a publique reproof.</hi> Grant that alſo, yet what need theſe peeviſh, bitter, and angry reflections? Hath Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> forgot that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>If any man be overtaken in a fault, ye that are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch a one in the Spirit of meekneſs:</hi> He contemptuouſly calls him (Maj. <hi>Danvers</hi> a <hi>Souldier</hi>) but why a Souldier? I confeſs an Officer ought to be a Soldier, but he was a Collonel as well as Mr. B. was a Chaplain, and Mr. B. knows 'tis not civil, nor do Souldiers love to be retrograded, no more than Chaplains. Would he think it kindly done, if he
<pb facs="tcp:108740:78"/>
were dwindled from a Chaplain in Folio to a puny Curate in duodecimo, I doubt his ambitious Humor would rather be Pope, but I ſuppoſe he means, that he was ſo once, and perhaps it was when M. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was Chaplain; and ſurely it is the Chaplain's work with all mildneſs and gentleneſs to convince his Officers of any error. But it's like in thoſe dayes he uſed better Language, and accomodated himſelf to the humors of his Officers, or elſe <hi>Fama mendax.</hi> But perhaps hee'll tell us, he looks upon Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> as a rigid Anabaptiſt; whom (with the Independents) he condemns and cenſures as ignorant ſilly perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his uſual Civility, not deſerving the leaſt grain of his Charity.</p>
                  <p>But what does the man mean? do they ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> ſo do's Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> Do they ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England?</hi> ſo did Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (as conſtituted by Epiſcopacy) but what he does now is a hard queſtion. But I ſhall leave Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> to vindicate himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Another thing notable, is his 56 <hi>Articles</hi> of Faith, that he ſuppoſes the Anabaptiſts and others muſt hold, if they deny his Popiſh Poſitions in his <hi>Chriſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, &amp;c.</hi> It were no hard matter to Father many groſſer abſurdities upon Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> were his raw and undigeſted Notions, and erroneous principles noted, that have paſt his Pen (at ſeveral times) for above theſe Twenty years. But leaving his other miſtakes, it will be no Injury to tell you, that one Article of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Faith is; <hi>That all the Children, all the numerous poſterity of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, yea of ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers whoſe immediate Parents or Parent, were not Enchurcht, are all in the Kingdom of the Devil, and neceſſarily damned.</hi> Seeing he holds that <hi>the Children
<pb facs="tcp:108740:78"/>
of Believers only are the Subjects of Baptiſm, being born within the Covenant of Grace, Children of God, Heirs of Chriſt, and inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in theſe Fifty ſix Articles (nay in moſt of his late Writings) hath not more gratified the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and contributed to their Cauſe, more than any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Divine ever did, yea at once, (as much as in him lyes) thrown away the Proteſtant Cauſe, and as far as his Credit goes, ſpoiled all, that our Famous Champions have done, I am much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken; having hereby lai'd ſuch ſtumbling blocks in the way of ordinary Chriſtians, far beyond the moſt crafty Jeſuite that ever hath been amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>He tells us he will Write no more, but he hath a mighty Faith that will believe him. I am of Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw's</hi> mind, who told him ſome time ſince, when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> told him he would not anſwer him; Mr. Bagſhaw replyes, <hi>I know you will not keep your word, for your pride will put you upon Writing, and your guilt will neceſſitate you to do it;</hi> juſt in as unbecoming a manner as you have done: <hi>for an ill Cauſe muſt be maintained by Calumny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then in a luſory way tells us, <hi>That if theſe Children will after this baul, and cry, and wrangle, and foul the Houſe</hi> (a ſavory Metaphor!) <hi>he is not bound to rock the Cradle, and to make them clean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence may it not follow (1.) That Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> owns the Anabaptiſts as his Children; but whether inſtead of an indulgent Nurſe he has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a cruel Step-mother, let the World judge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are ſoul, (ſweetly ſpoken!) and all the paines he hath taken in his Writings theſe Twenty years has been to clean them. But whether he hath not caſt more dirt and filth upon them, and
<pb facs="tcp:108740:79"/>
made them fouler than ever he found them, is eaſie to be determined by any that reads his plain Scripture-proof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing I obſerve is, How ſtrenuonſly he ſtrives to have the Fathers on his ſide; and fearing he ſhould loſe the Argument from Antiquity, we ſee how the ſleepy Lyon's rouſed, and roars like a Son of Thunder, fearing the Old worn-out cauſe of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm</hi> ſhould be routed, and never rally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; But he muſt know we are not ſo fond of the Fathers from the Third Century, that being as <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſayes, <hi>Omiſſis fontibus conſectari rivulos,</hi> we believe Infant-Baptiſm is ancient, and ſo are other Errors more antient; but from the beginning it was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o.</p>
                  <p>But that which confirms me againſt this Fallacy of Infant-Baptiſm, is, that the firſt that mention it, do alſo mention the Erroneous Grounds upon which it was practiſed, <hi>viz. for the waſhing away Original Sin; for the conferring of Grace, and abſolute neceſſity thereof to Salvation, &amp;c.</hi> But let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhew us if he can, that any of the Fathers ſpeaks of Infant-Baptiſm as to be performed upon the grounds he and others in this Land have practiced it, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Childs being in the Covenant of Grace by vertue of both or one of the Parents perſonally manifeſting his Faith and Repentance, and being an Enchurched Member of ſome Congregation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here I dare ſay, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has none of the Fathets of his ſide, now his Orthodox Fathers are Heterodox; but is it not ſtrange, that if Infant-Baptiſm were an Apoſtolical Tradition as divers affirmed, and ſome ſtill dream, that the Apoſtles had not delivered the true grounds upon which it ſhould be practiced as well as the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb facs="tcp:108740:79"/>
it ſelf. Or did theſe Holy Fathers only keep the ſubject, and ſo ſoon loſe the grounds. So that I muſt give this ſhort but true Character of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and his late Book that he hath written, neither with that gravity that became his Age, with that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety that became his profeſſion, nor with that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty that became any tolerable Education. And ſince he ſo much forgets himſelf, I muſt tell him that that Gentleman Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> whom he ſo inſolently deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is (to ſay no more) his Superior, a perſon of known worth, piety, and integrity, and one whom God hath choſen to bear witneſs to his truth, at that very time when he a Learned Scribe is ſhaken with every wind, and ſcruples not to change his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for and againſt things, as the ſtream of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſucceſs doth guide and influence them. I ſhall now conclude with Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Anabaptiſts, when his heat is over; he ſaith thus [in his laſt Book,] <hi>There two ſorts of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts amongſt us, the one are ſober Godly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who when they are Re-baptized, to ſatisfie their Conſciences, live amongſt us in Chriſtian love and peace. And I ſhall be aſhamed, if I love not them as heartily, and own them not as peacably as any of them ſhall do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther me, or better men than I, that differ from them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The other ſort hold it unlawful to hold Communion with ſuch as are not of their mind and way, and are Schiſmatically Troubleſome and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nquiet, in labouring to encreaſe their party.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I hope all the pious</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>do virtually, though not actually devote their Children to God, and Conſent to their Covenant-relation, while they vehemently plead againſt it; for ſurely they have ſo much natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if they did think that God would be a God, in a
<pb facs="tcp:108740:80"/>
ſpecial Covenant with their Children, and pardon their Original Sin, and give them right to future Life, upon the Parents dedication and conſent, they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly accept the gift and be thankful: And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve moſt of them would ſay, I would do all that God entruſteth me to do, that my Child may be a Child of God, and accept any Mercy from him, as far as God doth authorize me ſo to do,</hi> page 188, 199.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indeed my Judgement was and is, that the point of Infant-Baptiſm hath its conſiderable difficulties, which may occaſion Wiſe and Good men to doubt, or to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in it,</hi> page 219.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore I never took the point of it to have ſuch weight, as that all that differed from me in it, muſt be denyed either love, liberty, or communion. If I know my own heart, I do as heartily love a ſober Godly man that is againſt Infant-Baptiſm, as I do ſuch men that differ from me in other Controverſies: and much better than one of my own Judgement who hath leſs Piety and Sobriety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nor do I think there is ſo much Malignity in the bare Opinion which denyeth Infant Baptiſm, as that all the</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>miſcarriages ſhould ariſe from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Opinion.</hi> Ibid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I know that in the Ancient Churches men were left at Liberty, both when t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> would be Baptized themſelves, and when their Children ſhould be Baptized, and though Infant-baptiſm was without any Original ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, yet it was not a forced thing. And were it in my power, it ſhould be ſo ſtill, I would not deny Chriſtian-love, nor Church communion, nor publique Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to any pious peaceable man for being an</hi> Anabaptiſt. <hi>I am not therefore half ſo Zealous to turn men from</hi> Anabaptiſtry, <hi>as I am to perſwade both them and others to live together with mutual forbearance in Love and
<pb facs="tcp:108740:80"/>
Church-communion, notwithſtanding ſuch differences,</hi> page 221. <hi>I make no queſtion but many of them are far better men than I, and knowing my ſelf lyable to Error,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am far more offended at their Separation than their Opinion,</hi> page 228.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I know not by any Scripture or Reaſon that Re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing is ſo hainous a ſin as ſhould warrant us to contemn at our Brethren,</hi> page 233.</p>
                  <p>By which you ſee Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is not ſo much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> as their Separation. To which we ſay; Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> by his Elaborate Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems, and ſubtil Diſtinctions, firſt convince the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Baptiſts</hi> of their error herein, as the <hi>Independants,</hi> and others, and eſpecially his Friend Mr. <hi>Wills;</hi> who though he hath Written ſo much for Infant-Baptiſm, yet ('tis well known) he is a wide Separatiſt. May not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cry out againſt Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for his Separation? Might not the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do ſo formerly? And may they not ſtill, (yea Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> alſo) cry out againſt Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> and his party? and ſay they are Rigid <hi>Independents</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts?</hi> What means then all this Out-cry againſt the <hi>Antipaedo Baptiſts?</hi> unleſs they would have us believe that they are ſuch Univerſal Dictators as have Authority over Faith, and are Infallibly inſpired to propound Rules for all others, that when they Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate we muſt; and where they have Communion, ſo muſt we?</p>
                  <p>Now if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will vouchſafe to do Two Things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Tell us of what Church he is of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prove that Church to be rightly Conſtituted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Primitive Pattern: We will not then Separate from him. In the mean time we judge it
<pb facs="tcp:108740:81"/>
our duty, whereunto we have already attained, to Walk by the ſame Rule. And if any be otherwiſe-minded, we hope the Lord will in time reveal it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall not now Diſpute whether it be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly done by Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> to aſſail with ſo much Violence, one that's already beſet with ſuch clamarous <hi>Adverſaries</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wills:</hi> But he gives the Curious ſome occaſion to queſtion, that either (he thinks) they want <hi>Relief,</hi> being very near a <hi>Defeat;</hi> or have not ſo ſingular a Talent as himſelf to ſet off a <hi>bad Cauſe.</hi>

                  <p>Our Adverſaries themſelves are forced to confeſs that moſt of thoſe great Fathers (the generality of Chriſtians are ſo fond of) have been of <hi>Corrupt</hi> Principles, and tainted with <hi>Superſtitious</hi> conceits, and <hi>unſound Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and that there are but very few of them to be found throughly Orthodox, though of great <hi>Learning, Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Induſtry;</hi> which is an <hi>Item</hi> to us not to <hi>lean</hi> upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of man, though never ſo <hi>Celebrated</hi> by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Nations, but to have recourſe to the <hi>Word</hi> of truth left for our Inſtruction, and to ſeek our Warrant for Religious Duties there.</p>
                  <p>This conſideration ſatisfies me, That this <hi>Triumviri</hi> (however acted by confidence, or ſelf-conceit,) may be out of the way, and that their Dictates are no farther to be received, than they agree with the Word of God. The perplexing <hi>Syſtems</hi> ſpun out of mans own

I know how to diſtinguiſh between ſuch as by a miſtaken Zeal utter provoking raſh words; and ſuch as in purſuance to their Duty <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints:</hi> And that Believers Baptiſm is ſuch an Ordinance as Chriſt delivered to his Saints, I never heard doubted: And that

Infant (pretended) Baptiſm is not ſuch, is our work to manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>After all the Clutter our Antagoniſts kept to find ſome Evidence for the practice of <hi>Paedo-Baptiſm</hi> in <hi>Fathers, Councils,</hi> &amp;c. (the Scripture as they fully own being ſilent about it) they are glad to run for refuge at laſt to their new Invention of a <hi>Covenant</hi> they imagine to be made with the Carnal <hi>Seed</hi> of Believers, <hi>Gen. 17.7.</hi> which they ſay In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles them to be Baptized, but to no other Ordinance under the New Teſtament (a moſt pittiful Paradox) and being aſhamed to own the miſtaken abſurd <hi>Mediums,</hi> its old and moſt celebrated Patrons have Inſiſted upon for its <hi>Support</hi> in Old Times, they have Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in a more plauſible pretence for it, viz. the aforeſaid <hi>Covenant,</hi> which is their only <hi>Reſerve</hi> at preſent. And I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that Men of any Reaſon ſhould cry up <hi>Antiquity, Antiquity,</hi> at the Rate they do, when at the ſame Inſtant they reject the Grounds and Reaſons the Ancients uſed for the ſame. And is it fair to derive the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and add Reaſons of their <hi>Own,</hi> when the Old Reaſons are found to be indeed Irrational. We know <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> has been of an Early Birth, (viz. in the <hi>Third</hi> or <hi>Fourth Century</hi>) to ſave the
<pb facs="tcp:108740:84"/>
Child's Soul, and upon a miſtake that it might be <hi>Damned</hi> without it; But <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> upon the modern ground of a <hi>Hereditary Covenant,</hi> is new, and altogether unknown to the Ancient <hi>Paedo-Baptiſts,</hi> as by other hands is clearly made good.

We confeſs the <hi>Mageburgs</hi> were for Infant-Baptiſm, and that they cite <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> as Authors, that it was an Apoſtolical Tradition, in theſe words, <hi>Sed</hi> Origines <hi>&amp;</hi> Cyprianus <hi>&amp; alii Patres Authores ſunt Apoſtolorum etiam tempore baptizatos eſſe;</hi> Conſtat <hi>enim hoc ex Apoſtolorum Scriptis quod Infantes a Baptiſmo non excludant, nam dum Circumciſionis locum Baptiſmum ſupplere</hi> Paulus <hi>docet,</hi> Col. 2. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Reader is deſired to note how Craftily Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> ſtops in his Quotation at the words <hi>Conſtat
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108740:88"/>
ex Apoſtolorum Scriptis,</hi> i. e. it is <hi>evident from the Apoſtles Writings,</hi> to make the Reader believe they mean it (that Infants were Baptized,) whereas it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the following part of the ſentence, <hi>viz. (Quod Infantes a baptiſmo non excludant, that they did not exclude Infants from Baptiſm,</hi> rendring himſelf guilty of what he unjuſtly accuſes Mr. <hi>D.</hi> But to the Quotation:</p>
                  <p>Wherein we have Three Things urged by them as Arguments for their practice; Firſt the Teſtimony of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> Secondly, Arguments from Infants non-excluſion from Baptiſm Scriptures. Thirdly, an Inference to prove it lawful as ſucceeding Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Teſtimony of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> this I ſhall ſay little to, being ſubſtantially enervated by <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> already in his <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> where it is made out, (1.) that <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſay no ſuch thing; (2.) that if they had, its no great matter; the Books being from juſt grounds judged ſpurious: (3.) that if the Books were genuine, their Teſtimonies in the <hi>Third Century</hi> is not ſufficient to prove matter of <hi>Fact</hi> the Firſt Age.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Arguments from Infants non Excluſion being <hi>Mr. Whiſton's</hi> dear Argument ſo oft repeated, and made ſuch a flouriſh withall, and filling a good part of his Book, our Anſwer ſhall be refered to the place where he urges it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Inference from Circumciſion; this <hi>Mr. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> in expreſs terms tells us, is not made any ground of Infant Baptiſm by them in theſe words, We plead not for Infants Baptiſm, meerly from the Analogy it bears to Circumciſion (and is angry they ſhould be charged with it, (though his practice contradicts

the expreſſion very often, as well as the <hi>Mageburgs</hi> thereby) therefore I ſhall not ſpend time to diſprove that which he owns not. The Second Inſtance he gives of <hi>Mr. Ds.</hi> unfaithfulneſs, is, <hi>page</hi> 7. <hi>Mr. D.</hi> ſayes thus: As to Baptiſm in the <hi>Second Century,</hi> they ſay <hi>Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 109. that it doth not appear by any approved Author that there was any Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Mutation from the former, <hi>Which Mr.</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton is angry for, and ſayes, <hi>Mr.</hi> D. <hi>would make people believe he ſpake this of the ſubject of baptiſm, whereas it is of the Rites and Ceremonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have Examined what <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> ſayes, and that <hi>Century,</hi> and I find that he mentions neither ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject nor rite, but only cites their words, and applies it as fairly; their words are, <hi>Simplicem bapti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

practiced. I have read the Story of the <hi>Jew,</hi> which he upbraids Collonel <hi>D</hi> for over-looking, <hi>who like to dye, was upon his earneſt requeſt baptized</hi> (as they call it) <hi>by his fellow Travellers, by flinging Sand upon him, there being no poſſibility of having Water there.</hi> But what advantage this makes for <hi>Mr. Whiſton,</hi> we know not, let him make the beſt of it; if he had thought it ſo much for his purpoſe, why did not he mention it? but he choſes rather to make the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der believe there is ſomething in it for his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when indeed it ſignifies nothing for him.</p>
                  <p>The Second thing he remarks, is the impertinency of his proofs, and of which he gives Five Inſtances, how proper we are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But firſt, Is it not unjuſt for <hi>Mr. Whiſton</hi> to charge his Adverſary with that Crime whereof he himſelf is notoriouſly guilty; as I could inſtance if I would be impertinent, and for a taſte will begg the Readers pardon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark one. Is it to <hi>Mr. Whiſton's</hi> purpoſe, or does the Argument he manages require it, that he ſhould publiſh in print (firſt part of his Infant-Baptiſm) <hi>that he is a Batchelor, &amp;c.</hi> is the World concerned in the changes of his ſtate? or does he think that by the Charms of his Wit and Oratory, ſome great <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metiſſa</hi> will fall in Love with him? Is not that as impertinent a Proclamation as the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician's</hi> publiſhing his <hi>dull and lazy diſtemper?</hi> I would not have ſaid this, but to ſhew how he that's ſo nimble to fall upon others in print, ſhould take care firſt to amend himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And as to his Exceptions under this head, they are indeed ſo frivolous and inſignificant, that it is in vain to ſpend time to refute that which any Reader may do in the very peruſing; for what does he more

than pick up ſome ſcripshere and there, pickeering at a part as the preamble (or that that makes way) to the main thing, wherein all the <hi>force</hi> is put, and to which theſe paſſages he ſnatches up may be only Circumſtantial.

                  </p>
                  <p>And whether Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> (the Exceptions here made, being ſo few, and of ſo little weight) deſerves ſo ſevere a Caſtigation as this Author is pleaſed to give him, let the World judge.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we go on to try the oppoſition he makes as to the Doctrinal part. And firſt we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm:</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Believers Baptiſm is only Chriſts Baptiſm;</hi> which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> proved by the order laid down in the Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. to which Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> makes this demur; That <hi>this Commiſſion doth not exclude Infants from Baptiſm, ſuppoſing their Baptiſm elſewhere in Scripture warranted.</hi>

                  <p>That this is a very ſorry Evaſion, will appear, if you conſider that this is the ſolemn Inſtitution and Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles, impowring them <hi>to Preach the Goſpel, and Baptize;</hi> and to charge it with darkneſs and imperfection (as Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> doth,) is to reflect upon the Law giver; and for us to obſerve any Order, but what is here laid down, is to go beyond our Commiſſion, and be wiſe above what is written.

                  <p>Theſe words were ſpoken by the Elders of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Paul;</hi> in which are theſe things to be conſidered.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt, we are to examine, Whether <hi>Paul</hi> did Preach ſuch a Doctrine or no? 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Doctrine he Preach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d were true?</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, it is evident that <hi>Paul</hi> did preach ſo, that <hi>they muſt forſake Moſes, and not Circumciſe their Children, &amp;c.</hi> otherwiſe he need not have conſented to <hi>purifie</hi> himſelf, and ſo far to <hi>Judaize,</hi> contrary to the Goſpel, and his own light; his denial only, of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108740:96"/>
the matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> would have been a ſufficient Confutation of ſuch a Rumor: But he denies it not (that would be to forſake his Goſpel-Miniſtry) but in a peaceable condeſcenſion, complies to purifie himſelf, that he may appear to be no Contemner of the Law, that removing their prejudice, he may have opportunity to preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Anti-type of all their Typical Adminiſtrations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That alſo is undoubted, that the Goſpel-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he preached, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> and all others ought to forſake <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The next doubt is, What is meant by forſaking of <hi>Moſes?</hi> To which I Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To forſake him as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the Goſpel Church, God having now raiſed up another <hi>Prophet,</hi> whom we muſt Hear in all things relating to the matter and manner of Worſhip in the Houſe of God: For though <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful in his Houſe, as a Servant, yet he muſt give way to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Great Prophet, Heb,</hi> 3. and no longer give <hi>Laws,</hi> or preſcribe <hi>Rules</hi> about the matter or manner of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; yea nothing as to the Subject, Time, or Place, is to be received from him; but in all things we muſt be inſtructed by that <hi>Prophet</hi> that God hath <hi>raiſed up from amongſt our Brethren:</hi> this is the ſubſtance of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Not to Circumciſe their Children, is to forſake</hi> Moſes, as the Text particularly makes out; becauſe Circumciſion was a Law or Doctrine they had learn't from <hi>Moſes;</hi> for though Circumciſion was firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet it is called <hi>Moſes Law, John</hi> 7.22. <hi>Moſes therefore gave unto you Circumciſion, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:108740:97"/>
But you muſt forſake this Law or Doctrine of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and not Circumciſe your Children any more. This ſounds very Harſh, and was very grievous and offenſive to them, that it cauſed ſuch Fear in the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that ſome Trouble and Hazard to his Perſon would follow; which was the ground of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in purifying themſelves, to <hi>pacifie</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> for the preſent; they being ſo exceeding zealous for the Law, and eſpecially for Circumciſing their Children, that Oppoſition was Death, or ſevere Puniſhment. Now had <hi>Paul</hi> told them, their Children ſhould be <hi>Baptized,</hi> and that Baptiſm was come into the <hi>room</hi> of Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all likelihood it would have quieted them. But ſeeing there is no mention of any ſuch thing, that He preached ſuch Doctrine amongſt them (which without Controverſie would have been mentioned, had he done ſo) it plainly appears that <hi>Paul</hi> knew no ſuch thing, neither had he any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to preach ſuch Doctrine, as the Baptizing of Infants amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>And this further is confirmed, if we conſider the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the <hi>First Council,</hi> who were met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this very Doctrine of Circumciſing Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſtill ſo zealous for, and knew not how to bear the Abrogation of it, (though they did believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>) and they would have enjoyn'd it upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. Now if it were a duty to Baptize Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Circumciſing of them, then the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were unfaithful in not telling them of it, eſpecially at this time, when there was ſo fair an opportunity to quiet their Conſciences, and to put the matter out of doubt, and for ever to caſhier the Doctrine of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which we ſee the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Teachers were
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108740:97"/>
afterwards endeavouring to promote. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> mention no ſuch thing as Baptizing of Infants in their debates in this Council, nor in their Letters they ſent to the <hi>Churches,</hi> it is evident they received no ſuch Commiſſion from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And how any man can Believe otherwiſe, and not reflect <hi>imprudence,</hi> yea horrible <hi>unfaithfulneſs</hi> upon the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> I cannot imagine.</p>
                  <p>The next to be conſidered in this Text is, that the <hi>Jews</hi> are alſo forbidden <hi>to walk after the cuſtom,</hi> that is after the <hi>manner,</hi> for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is rendred, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1. <hi>unleſs ye be Circumciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) So that this word Cuſtom, or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> prohibits not only all Obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> bvt alſo all walking after the ſame <hi>way</hi> and manner, as the Ordinances of the Law were adminiſtred in. Here is not only an Injunction of non-conformity to the Law, but to the <hi>manner</hi> of it alſo. They are not only forbidden to Circumciſe their Children, but alſo to walk after the Cuſtom or Manner of Circumciſion; and therefore not to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize their Children. <hi>Paul</hi> might have ſaid, indeed to Circumciſe your Children was the Cuſtom and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Old; but as for the Baptizing them, we have no ſuch cuſtom, nor the Churches of God.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is clear, that Infants Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip is repealed, and conſequently have no right to Baptiſm. For,</p>
                  <p>If Infants (as our Modern <hi>Paedo-Baptiſts</hi> alledge) <hi>were virtually Commanded to be Baptized in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for Circumciſion;</hi> and that Infant-Circumciſion, and Infant-Baptiſm were both Inſtituted <hi>together</hi> (as they that bring the later from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. muſt needs hold;) then they are both <hi>uncommanded</hi> again, in theſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108740:98"/>
very words, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.21, where God by the mouth of <hi>Paul</hi> forbad them to <hi>Circumciſe</hi> their Children any longer, and to walk after the Old Cuſtoms. I ſay again, if Infant-Baptiſm was commanded in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for Circumciſion of Infants, then by Analogie (for <hi>Contrariorum, contraria eſt ratio,</hi>) Infant-Baptiſm muſt needs be abrogated, and remanded, in the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and remanding of Circumciſion. And though I do not believe, that the precept to Circumciſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, was ſo much as a Virtual or Conſequential Command to Baptize them; yet it is an Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> at leaſt; and I hope the <hi>Paedo-baptiſts</hi> will be very willing to receive the ſame <hi>meaſure</hi> they give; and reſt ſatisfied in this, that the <hi>Countermand to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe Infants is a Conſequential and Virtual Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand to Baptize them.</hi> By all which it appears, that Infant-Church memberſhip is repealed, becauſe the ſame Law that gave being to it, is repealed. And whether this be not as plain (yea plainer) Scripture-proof, as any Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath in his Book ſo Intituled, is left to the judgement of the Conſiderate and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader.</p>
                  <p>Now he comes to it, and promiſes to direct us where thoſe other Revelations of Gods will are, that Infants ſhould be Baptized: And reading on very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, and going with patience through his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambular Extravagancies, and wide fetches, he brings me at laſt to the ſaying of <hi>Peter</hi> to the <hi>Jews, The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to you and your Children;</hi> and the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to a <hi>Gentile, Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be Saved, and thy Houſe:</hi> Which put together, is his other Revelation (he brags ſo much of) for Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:108740:98"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now we are to encounter with all his ſtrength at once; therefore let us try the force of this mighty Argument. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If he can ſpell ſuch a meaning out of it, 'tis more than we can do; and if he had a mind to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, he ſhould expreſs himſelf in more familiar terms. As <hi>what this promiſe was.</hi> (2.) <hi>Whether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, or conditional.</hi> (3.) <hi>How Extenſive?</hi> But ſince he hath left us in the dark, let us a little examine it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What this promiſe is?</hi> And we ſay, that it muſt be either of ſome Temporal Bleſſing, or the Holy Spirit, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. in this World; or Life and Salvation hereafter. The two firſt Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> will not pretend to, becauſe they have no reference to his Baptiſm. It is the laſt then, <hi>viz. the promiſe of Life and Salvation,</hi> he inſiſts upon, as <hi>p.</hi> 34. And then the words of <hi>Peter</hi> will run thus; <hi>the promiſe</hi> (of Life and Salvation (<hi>is to you</hi> (Jews) <hi>and your Children, and to as many as are afar off,</hi> which all agree to be the Gentiles, <hi>and as many as the Lord your God ſhall call,</hi> (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>definitely without diſtinction, whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Now this promiſe ſo paraphraſed, is either <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,</hi> or <hi>Conditional:</hi> If abſolute, then all <hi>Jews, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and their <hi>Children</hi> are Saved, whether they Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or not: If you underſtand it conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> that they firſt profeſs Faith in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and receive him as their Saviour; then we are agreed.</p>
                  <p>And if you ſay, <hi>It is Conditional to the Adult, not their Seed:</hi> I anſwer, Then it muſt be abſolute to the Seed; if ſo, then all their Seed muſt needs be Saved. And then, How come ſo many of them to be ſo <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>wicked?</hi> if you ſay 'tis only to ſome; then it muſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108740:99"/>
follow, that ſome Believers Children ought only to be Baptized, <hi>viz.</hi> the Elect; but 'tis impoſſible to aſſign which are Elect, and which non Elect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uncertain from that ground, which ought, and which ought not to be Baptized. And if you ſay, <hi>the Covenant of Grace</hi> (or promiſe of Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>be made to Believers Seed only,</hi> and conſequently they only have right to Baptiſm: then it will follow, that the Church is not to be raiſed out of the Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Unbelievers, which is abſurd; for the Goſpel is to be Preached to <hi>gather</hi> in the Elect, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are in the Covenant of Grace: But if the Children of Believers only are in the Covenant of Grace, then to what purpoſe is the Goſpel preached to the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Unbelievers, unleſs it be to harden them? for ſuppoſe a Nation of <hi>Indians,</hi> whoſe Parents were all Heathens, and who therefore (according to your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) with their preſent Children, are not in the Covenant of Grace, Will you Preach to them? If you do, I ask you to what purpoſe? you'll ſay, To bring them into the Covenant of Grace. Then it ſeems there are two wayes to come into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; one by being the <hi>Natural</hi> Child of a Believer; the other by <hi>Actual</hi> Faith. But this is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, for there is no being in the Covenant of Grace, but by <hi>Election</hi> on Gods part; and <hi>actual Faith</hi> on Mans part.</p>
                  <p>And if you ſtill ſay, That Believers Infants <hi>only</hi> are in the viſible Covenant of Grace, and all the Seed of Unbelievers excluded; then I demand, Whether you do not make two Covenants of Grace, Viſible, and Inviſible? But if you deny that (for 'tis hard to know where to find you) and ſay your Children are Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the Covenant of Grace, when others are not. I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108740:99"/>
Anſwer; you delude us very often with the word <hi>(Viſible)</hi> for ſometimes your Infants are, ſometimes they are not in the Covenant <hi>(viſibly;)</hi> ſo that this term is as ambiguous and myſtical as words of <hi>Cabal.</hi> 2. But if you mean by <hi>Viſibly,</hi> that they are plainly and manifeſtly obvious to the view of all perſons that are capable of ſeeing in the Covenant, then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your Viſibility. And if you mean, by <hi>Viſible,</hi> that they are in the Covenant, as far as you can judg, ſince you know nothing to the contrary: We ſay the ſame of Unbelievers Infants; for they may be in the Covenant for any thing we know, nothing appearing in their Infancy to the contrary; and, <hi>Praeſumere unum quem<expan>

                  <p n="3">3. If by <hi>(Viſibly)</hi> you underſtand outwardly, or in the outward part of the Covenant, which is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; we anſwer, That Baptiſm is no more the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the Covenant, than the <hi>Purſe</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains money is the outward part of the <hi>money;</hi> or the <hi>Conduit</hi> the outward part of the Water; or <hi>Aarons</hi> Pot that held the <hi>Manna,</hi> the outward part of the <hi>Manna<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> For Baptiſm is a Symbol of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, Repentance, Self-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to affirm, that it is the outward part of the Covenant, is a very Fancy, and meer <hi>Chimaera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that you ſee what a Heap of irregular Jarrings and Abſurdities follow the Aſſertion, that the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Carnal Seed, as ſuch, are to inherit this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>And now I am come to the next conſideration, which is, <hi>The extenſiveneſs of this promiſe;</hi> and this is determined in the Text, it is <hi>(to all that are afar off)</hi> equal to the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham;</hi> which ſpoils the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108740:100"/>
pretence from the <hi>Birth priviledge.</hi> But what puts the matter out of doubt, is the next phraſe, <hi>(Even as many as the Lord your God ſhall call;)</hi> which expounds the former, and proves that calling (or Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is the condition of the promiſe, and that only ſuch as are called of <hi>Jew Gentile,</hi> and their Children, are Inheritors of it, according to <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29,</p>
                  <p>As to that expreſſion, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be Saved, and thy Houſe.</hi> Is it Mr. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>'s meaning, that all in the Houſe, Servants, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Saved, though Unconverted, by the Faith of the Maſter? (but that's a concluſion, he durſt not ſtand by:) Or is that promiſe of Salvation given to him, and his Houſhold, upon the condition of his and the Houſholds Faith individually? If this latter be his ſenſe, we joyn with him in it; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the former as abſurd, and unſound: For if it were allowed, then one may be Saved by the Faith of another (a Fancy exploded by all Proteſtants) and ſo it were enough to Save all <hi>England,</hi> if every <hi>Maſter</hi> of a Family had been a Believer. I would ask Mr. <hi>W.</hi> if taking himſelf to be a Believer, he would Baptize his Servant, and believe him Saved, though an Unbeliever, upon that ground? If it be his Religion, his practiſe ſhall not be my example.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if the Covenant promiſe, they ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently affirm to belong to Believers Children only, muſt be limited to them, and extend no further; how come Servants that are not ſo concerned in the Birth-priviledg, nor the Seed of Believers, to be pleaded for by this man, to have a right to Baptiſm and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon the Maſters Faith? We grant they have as much right to it, as the Children (that is none at all till Converted) for the Text ſaies, <hi>Thou and thy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108740:100"/>
Houſe,</hi> (and I preſume the <hi>Servant</hi> is one of the Houſe. So that a Believers Servant has as much right to be Baptized, as the Believers Child, though the Servant cannot pretend to be the Iſſue of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parents: And if ſo, What's the Reaſon they Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize not their Servants, they having the ſame Title with their Children to it. And indeed if they will grant, that the Maſter, or Chief Man's Faith, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to intitle all his Family, or thoſe under his Government to Baptiſm and Salvation; then if the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or the <hi>Pope,</hi> or Great <hi>Turk</hi> be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, 'tis enough to Warrant our <hi>Paedo-Baptiſts</hi> to Baptize not only all in their great <hi>Courts,</hi> but all that Inhabit their <hi>Territories</hi> alſo; their Subjects being their Servants. And how pure ſuch a Doctrine is, that would force ſo groſs an abſurdity upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, let the World judge.</p>
                  <p>So that I humbly conceive it is very evident, that neither the one nor the other Scripture, jointly, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally holds forth the promiſe of Salvation, or a right to Baptiſm to any one, upon any other account, than the <hi>Condition of perſonal Faith.</hi> And that Mr. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>'s confident boaſt of other Revelations is an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty flouriſh.</p>
                  <p>He ſaies, <hi>p.</hi> 35. <hi>It was very rational, yea neceſſary, the Commiſſion ſhould be expreſt in the Order it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe to whom the Apoſtles were ſent, were in a ſtate of darkneſs, and ignorance, wholly eſtranged from God and his wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's a certain truth, which we oppoſe not; but is there not the ſame neceſſity ſtill? Are not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a ſtate of darkneſs, ignorance, and wholly eſtranged from God now, as well as then, till Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? Are not the Infants you Sprinkle, <hi>Children
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108740:101"/>
of Wrath</hi> as well as others? And therefore is it not as neceſſary that the preaching of the Goſpel ſhould be antecedent to Baptiſm now, as (they confeſs) it was then? For my part I know no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Heathen</hi> and an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever;</hi> they are both alike <hi>diſtant</hi> from God, and both equally <hi>capable</hi> of his converting Grace. And this ſerves for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, as well as the two following Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being of the ſame purport.</p>
                  <p>He affirms, <hi>page</hi> 37. <hi>That the promiſe of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Covenant of Grace, in which the promiſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is ſtill extended to the Houſes or Families of Believers, as ſuch.</hi> To which I ſay, as before, that his ſayings would be more regarded, if he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to <hi>prove</hi> them. But however, if he means it conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> if they believe, they may be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and Saved, we grant it: But if he intends it poſitively, that the <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Faith is enough to Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the whole <hi>Family</hi> to Salvation, the Covenant of Grace and Baptiſm, without their perſonal Faith, we abſolutely deny it; and he has not yet proved it, nor indeed is he able to do it.</p>
                  <p>He goes on, ſtill harping upon the ſame ſtring, and tells us, <hi>page</hi> 38. <hi>That if Mr.</hi> Danvers <hi>could have produced any one Scripture, wherein the Apoſtles did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Infants, or in their practice did refuſe to Baptize them, he had ſaid ſomething to his purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis an unpleaſant task to be anſwering to the very ſame thing ſo often; that when this <hi>Protaeus</hi> varies his word, but not his ſenſe, to make the Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is a new Argument, ſhall we be obliged to be as impertinent in replying, as he is in inhauncing the bulk of his Book by ſuch trifling Repetitions?

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Have we not again and again affirmed, (and which is no other than pure Proteſtant Doctrine; Witneſs Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his anſwer to Mr. <hi>Parker, page</hi> 345. where he calls what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here urges a <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſophiſtical Tale, by which ten thouſand things may be made lawful.</hi> And a little further ſaies, <hi>that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing (eſteemed as any part of Divine Worſhip) is forbidden, that is not commanded.)</hi> That the affirmative Command includes the Negative; and ſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to Baptize Believers, and the conſtant practice of the Apoſtolical primitive times to Baptize <hi>only</hi> ſuch, is enough to warrant the excluſion of Infants from that Ordinance; ſo that the Scripture indeed <hi>excludes</hi> them, in as much as it doth not <hi>include</hi> them: and the command of Baptizing perſons upon a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith,</hi> excludes ſuch as cannot, or will not make ſuch a profeſſion. But he would have us tell him, <hi>Where or when the Apoſtles refuſed to Baptize a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</hi> But it were more proper for him, to give us ſome inſtance when any were brought or offered to them to be Baptized, for we read of none refuſed, becauſe none offered; and certainly had it been the practice to Baptize Infants, we ſhould have ſome inſtance of it in ſome part of the New-Teſtament. We never yet found in Scripture that the Apoſtles refuſed to Baptize the Children of Unbelievers, ſhall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108740:102"/>
we therefore conclude they were Baptized. But we read, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.14.

Beſides the Text ſaies, <hi>they brought them only to be touched by our Saviour,</hi> and he <hi>bleſt, not Baptiz'd them;</hi> and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any Infants had a right to be Baptized, thoſe Infants had it; for Chriſt ſays, <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> he knew if they were of the Elect, and therefore it would be no Hazard to baptize them, had he allowed it. But this Text indeed informs us, that our Children may be bleſt, and be of the Kingdom of Heaven, by the application of Gods Free Grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm; which is only a <hi>Duty</hi> to ſuch as it is commanded to, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are capable of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi> But,</p>

place he calls <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> which is in plain Engliſh that he pleads, and pleads not, from <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion:</hi> So that I know not how to come at him. This is a new way of diſtinction, to diſtinguiſh <hi>Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> he would ſeem to leave that baffled <hi>argument</hi> of ſome of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and yet he cannot but be at it again.</p>
                  <p>We acknowledg there was a Command obliging <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations to be Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, (which he means by the token of the Covenant,) but that adminiſtration came to its period at the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore the command of being Circumciſed is not in force now. Nor have we any new Command that Believers and their Seed muſt be baptized in their Generations; beſides the term <hi>Generations</hi> is frequently uſed to ſignifie a certain and limited time, <hi>the burning of the Kidnies,</hi> and the <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Fat of Beaſts</hi> to be Sacrificed, is ſaid to be <hi>a perpetual Statute in their Generations, Lev.</hi> 3.17. So the <hi>Offerings made by fire,</hi> Lev. 6.18. <hi>The Feaſt of Booths.</hi> Lev. 23.41. which nevertheleſs have their period with the Law. So where God promiſes to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his carnal Seed in their <hi>Generations,</hi> it is meant during the <hi>Legal adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> not but that if <hi>Abraham</hi> be underſtood as a <hi>Spiritual Father, God</hi> will be a <hi>God</hi> to him, and his Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> (ſuch as did believe as he did) without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, <hi>for ever.</hi> Whereas if he be underſtood as a <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Parent, the Covenant then muſt needs be underſtood (to make any thing for them) abſolute and everlaſting; but that were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, for the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing <hi>Jews</hi> have broke the Covenant, and are now cut off, which they could not have been, if that Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were true.</p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:108740:104"/>But that the Covenant was not abſolute (as it reſpected the Temporal ot Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>) I evince thus: If (while the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was in being) God denies <hi>himſelf to be their God, and diſowns them as his people, becauſe of their tranſgreſſion,</hi> then the promiſe was <hi>Conditional,</hi> not abſolute, but the Antecedent is true, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.14.</p>
                  <p>But if you lay ſo much ſtreſs upon that expreſſion, that God ſhould be a God to you and your Seed, what account will it amount unto? for you can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply nothing of the Promiſe to them, but the bare outward act of Baptizing (or rather Rantizing?) but what of favour or Spiritual ſaving-mercy is that? or what advantage is it? ſince the Children that dye Unbaptized, are as capable of Salvation, as thoſe you Baptize. For it is the Proteſtant Doctrine, not to aſcribe Salvation <hi>Opere operato,</hi> and therefore Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm confers not Grace, nor Saves the dying Soul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in conjunction with <hi>Faith,</hi> which applies the <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Spiritual Seed, reſpects <hi>Salvable</hi> Mercies, Grace here, and Glory hereafter; but Baptiſm of Infants can confer neither, therefore it is not the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor need we yield to that Opinion that would force us to acknowledg no Covenant but what is mutual, becauſe this Covenant conſiſts of Free Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo rather a Teſtament than Covenant, as <hi>Ames Mar.</hi> Divinity, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. affirms.

If we ſhould take no notice of any thing he ſaies further, but apply our Arguments only to that, it were enough, ſince if this be once com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Which piece of Service the <hi>Doctor</hi> has excellently done to our hands, proving undeniably that <hi>Abraham</hi> has but two Seeds, the <hi>natural Jew,</hi> and actual <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Believers;</hi> and that ſuch only as are Heirs of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, have right to <hi>Goſpel priviledges,</hi> the old <hi>Faederal</hi> right being inſufficient to entitle the <hi>Jews</hi> thereto; therefore let Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> either convince the <hi>Doctor</hi> if this be an error, or be convinced by him, in caſe it be a truth: Or let him reconcile that <hi>Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> to the practice of Baptizing Infants upon a <hi>Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral</hi>

Right, or tell us plainly, in what third capacity the Infant ſeed of Believers now are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſince they are not his natural Seed (as all muſt own) nor (as the Doctor well words it in the caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi>) can they, wanting perſonal Faith, be counted his Spiritual Seed?</p>
                  <p>But however a little to examine this foundation-principle, three Things are to be offered to our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry: 1. <hi>Whether the Covenant Believers are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, be the ſame eſtabliſht with</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed.</hi> 2. <hi>Whether Circumciſion be the ſign, token, or ſeal of that Covenant.</hi> 3. <hi>Whether Baptiſm doth ſucceed in the place, uſe, and room of Circumciſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the firſt I ſay as before, that the Covenant muſt be conſidered in a two-fold reſpect; 1. In reſpect to <hi>Spiritual</hi> Bleſſings, <hi>Grace</hi> here, and <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter; ſo it is and was the ſame to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spiritual Seed in and through all Generations from him to us, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as Believed as he did. 2. In reſpect to Temporal bleſſings, and ſo it was peculiar to his Natural and Spiritual Seed, during the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-diſpenſation, and Typical adminiſtrations; and in that reſpect it is not the ſame, Believers being now under the former, not the later.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Abraham</hi> is conſidered under the notion of a double <hi>Father-hood,</hi> ſo there muſt be a double <hi>Son-ſhip</hi> to anſwer that Relation; the <hi>Jews</hi> were his Sons in one capacity, namely a Carnal Generation, of which they were wont to bragg, as appears by the reproof <hi>John</hi> gave them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father;</hi> and in the other capacity all Believers, whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> are his <hi>children:</hi> This is evidenced <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. <hi>They are not all</hi> Iſrael <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108740:106"/>
which are the children of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſhews us, that their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation gives not the true notion of <hi>Son-ſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jew</hi> as a Natural Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> may pretend to Baptiſm, and New-Teſtament-Ordinances by a <hi>priority</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Offer, Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. Therefore Chriſt commanded his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> not to go into the wayes of the <hi>Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> but <hi>to the loſt ſheep of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, and Preach the Goſpel to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.10. <hi>to the</hi> Jew <hi>firſt, and alſo to the</hi> Gentile; and this gave occaſion to the Speech of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is to you and your Children,</hi> viz. primarily; and to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo but ſecondarily, which they of the <hi>Circumciſion were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſht at, Acts</hi> 10.45. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> are called <hi>afar off,</hi> ſuitable to <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Ye</hi> (Gentiles) <hi>who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Now as it was the preheminence of the <hi>Jews</hi> to have the Goſpel firſt Preached to them, ſo we find their carnal prerogative ſtand them in no ſtead, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.8. where they are informed that Goſpel-Ordinances are not bottom'd upon Carnal Generation, or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; but true Holineſs manifeſted by the fruit it brings forth, <hi>viz.</hi> Fruits meet for Repentance: <hi>He came to his own, but they received him not;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>as many as received him,</hi> whether Jew or Gentile, <hi>to them he gave power to become the Sons of God;</hi> and to receive him, is to <hi>believe in his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men are now admitted to Ordinances upon other conſiderations than legal denominations of clean or unclean, <hi>viz.</hi> fearing God, and working righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is not generated or <hi>conveyed</hi> by Birth, but by the New birth, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the living God.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108740:107"/>
Therefore if the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> could not pretend a right to New-Teſtament Ordinances by that Title, much leſs the Adopted Seed, by any ſuch way of Natural Generation. And if their Birth-right could not ſerve them, how can our Birth-right ſerve us?</p>
                  <p>And this may ſerve as an Anſwer to the firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; that the Covenant as it reſpected Life and Salvation to Believers, is one and the ſame now as then. But as it reſpects external adminiſtrations, and the qualification of Church-members it is not the ſame; the legal, typical, faederal right vaniſht, and <hi>Faith</hi> is now the only qualification.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, <hi>Whether Circumciſion be the token, ſign, or ſeal of the Covennnt?</hi> This needs but a ſhort Reply, for we find it to be called <hi>the token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Gen.</hi> 17.11. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>calls it the ſign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> intimating by diſtinguiſhing between a <hi>Sign</hi> and a <hi>Seal,</hi> that Circumciſion was to all a <hi>Sign,</hi> but to <hi>Abraham</hi> alone a Seal of the righteouſneſs of Faith. And we find Circmuciſion never called a Seal, but where it ſpeaks of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which intimates that it was only a Seal to him. And this is ſutable to what <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theophilact,</hi> and others (quoted upon the place by a very judicious pen) <hi>viz. It was called a Seal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, becauſe it was given to</hi> Abraham <hi>as a Seal and teſtimony of that righteouſneſs which he had acquired by Faith: Now this ſeems to be the priviledg of</hi> Abraham <hi>alone, and not to be transferred to others, as if Circumciſion, in whom ever it was, were a teſtimony of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and being already the father of all uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, having faith in uncircumciſion, he received firſt the ſign of Circumciſion, that he might be the father of the Circumciſed.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether Baptiſm doth ſucceed in the room, place, and uſe of Circumciſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To anſwer this doubt, let us conſider the great <hi>difference</hi> between Circumciſion, and Baptiſm. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was a <hi>legal</hi> Ordinance appointed to the Jewiſh Males Reprobate as well as Elect, by a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command to diſtinguiſh them from the reſt of the World, as a Token of the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come of his Loins according to the Fleſh. But</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:108740:108"/>Baptiſm is an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Ordinance, whereby Jew or Gentile, Male or Female, upon a profeſſion of Faith and Repentance is baptized in Water, in token of Regeneration, and to ſignifie the <hi>death, burial,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> already come, and ſo added to the Viſible Church, and admitted to all the priviledges thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being not the Office of Circumciſion, Baptiſm cannot be ſaid to ſucceed in its room, place, and uſe.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of the great difference in their inſtitution illuſtrates this alſo; for when Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Baptiſm, he ſaies, <hi>Go teach, and baptize;</hi> and in the adminiſtration, <hi>they confeſſed and were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, Believed and were Baptized;</hi> not a word of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. And in the Precept of Circumciſion, not a word of <hi>Teaching,</hi> or <hi>Faith;</hi> but of Infants the command expreſly notes the <hi>time, age,</hi> and <hi>ſex.</hi> The Levitical and Typical Holineſs in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſhold, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natural or adopted, included not Regeneration, nor heart cleanneſs, which is our holineſs; land, fruit, and trees were holy, in a typical conſideration, when Circumciſion was predicated of <hi>Trees</hi> as well as <hi>Men, Lev.</hi> 9.23. And for us to affirm that Trees ought to be now baptized as they were then reputed to be Circumciſed, is a wild way of reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſince things become Ordinances to us by vertue of a word of inſtitution, and no ſuch word is found to make out that Baptiſm ſucceeds Circumciſion in its room, place, and uſe, we think it ſafe to be ſober, and advance no further than the Scripture guides. And to make Circumciſion inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Baptiſm, is to ſend us to School to the Law, and that <hi>Old firſt vaniſhing Covenant,</hi> as it is ſtiled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. as if the Law-giver in the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108740:108"/>
not by a poſitive inſtitution eſtabliſht his Ordinances there, nor left us any Warrant for our Goſpel-Duties, without that retrogreſsion to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and aſſimilating them to the Paedagogy and ſimilitude of Types.</p>
                  <p>So that theſe things being found meer miſtakes on Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi>'s ſide, we may conclude (in his own words, <hi>that they have no ſure footing in the Covenant for the baptizing of Infants.</hi>

                  <p>He ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 81. <hi>The Covenant Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>was made with</hi> Abraham <hi>in both capacities,</hi> viz. <hi>as a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Spiritual Father.</hi> What then? This is a meer <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi,</hi> and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has a peculiar Talent to prove that which is not deny'd. But to this I have ſpoke before.</p>
                  <p>He argues, <hi>page</hi> 89. thus: <hi>If</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau <hi>in their Infant-ſtate, were heirs of the World, through the righteouſneſs of Faith, when they had no perſonal faith, then the Infant-ſeed of Believers may be ſo too.</hi> But — <hi>Ergo</hi> — the Text he grounds upon is <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9. <hi>dwelling in Tabernacles with</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>heirs with him of the ſame Promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vanity of which conſequence will appear, if you conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is nothing in that Text to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his aſſertion: We grant <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were heirs of the ſame Promiſe, as well in reſpect of Gods Covenant with their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, as their own perſonal faith, when they came to years; but that it ſhould follow, that all the Carnal Seed of Believers ſhould be ſo too, is that that needs proof, and we deny.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I humbly conceive, That to be heirs of the world through the righteouſneſs of faith, and yet
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108740:109"/>
have no perſonal faith, as he words it, is meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and non ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The promiſe to which <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were heirs, is, That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come of their Loins, according to the Fleſh, and how that (being already fulfilled) can be applicable to the children of believers, I cannot tell, nor Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi> neither: Therefore his Syllogiſm is vain and empty.</p>
                  <p>He proceeds <hi>pag.</hi> 93. To demand, <hi>Whether there be any Original Sin? If ſo, how came any Infants to be ſaved, unleſs through the righteouſneſs of faith?</hi> viz. <hi>Gods non imputation of guilt to them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if they are capable of the righteouſneſs of faith, why may they not have that righteouſneſs ſealed to them by an outward and viſible ſign?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To wave many things that may be ſaid to ſhew the childiſhneſs of the <hi>Quaere,</hi> we ſay, The ſame reaſon may be urged for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> children; for if they be capable of the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in order to their ſalvation, <hi>viz. non imputing ſin, and imputing the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to them as well as the children of Believers;</hi> then (at your rate of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) they have as good right to the outward viſible Sign. If you deny the former, you impeach the free grace of Chriſt, and have little of Chriſtian Charity. If you grant it, your Poſition's overthrown.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 101. he tells us (if we'll believe him) <hi>That Circumciſion was adminiſtred to the Adult, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as believers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I confeſs, I do not underſtand, what he means by Believers. I thought the term <hi>[Believer]</hi> had not been uſed to have been appropriated to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but in reſpect to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> viz. Such as had ſome knowledge of, and believed in, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108740:109"/>
or already come: Otherwiſe ſueh of the <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> who believe a <hi>Deity,</hi> but not a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> muſt needs be ſaved. I am ſure the <hi>Jews</hi> are accounted <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> to this day, becauſe they <hi>reject</hi> Chriſt, which could not be, if their admiſſion to <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and to be Members of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> and the <hi>Church of Old,</hi> had been upon the account of faith. So that there is no truth in this poſition; for it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the Proſelytes, or any others, were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> before they were circumciſed; or that they gave any teſtimony of their belief in him: but only that they <hi>owned</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Iſrael to be the true God,</hi> and were willing to be joyned to that <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> knows, that that is not ſufficient now, there muſt be ſaith in Chriſt, elſe no believer.</p>
                  <p>But what would he conclude from hence? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Adult that were circumciſed, were eonſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Believers; if he ſay, So all the Adult that are baptized, are to be ſo conſidered (which is the moſt natural inference that can be drawn hence) we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.</p>
                  <p>But I perceive the <hi>pains</hi> he takes here, is to make way for that abſurd <hi>Poſition</hi> he is now coming to (and which I conceive he is the <hi>Protoplaſt</hi> of) <hi>pag.</hi> 116. <hi>That Circumciſion was adminiſtred to the Jewiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, conſidered as the ſeed of Believers.</hi> By the way, I wonder the man will trouble himſelf ſo much about Circumciſion, when he profeſſes ſo gravely, <hi>pag.</hi> 75. <hi>That he pleads not for Baptiſm from any Analogy with it.</hi> Which would make one ſuſpect, that he is apt to forget himſelf, or that he thinks we'll believe any thing; ſo ſoon as he pronounces his Magiſterial, <hi>Thus I ſay it, &amp;c.</hi> But let's hear how he proves
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108740:110"/>
it; <hi>Why</hi> (ſays he) <hi>becauſe the Adult that were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, were conſidered as the ſeed of Believers.</hi> A worthy proof indeed, but 'tis all we are like to have. He takes it for granted (it ſeems) that the Adult were circumciſed as Believers, and grounds his Argument upon it as his <hi>Medium.</hi> But Logicians will tell him, that ſuch a way of Argumentation is but a ſilly <hi>Petitio Principii;</hi> or <hi>begging the queſtion.</hi> But in order to a further and more particular ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I offer theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Congregrative <hi>Body</hi> of the People, or Jewiſh Males, were Circumciſed in their Infancy; purſuant to the Command of God, being elſe to be cut off from his people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. and therefore this Argument being grounded upon a falſe <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> will vaniſh. Beſides it is a <hi>non-ſequitur:</hi> for will it follow, That if the Adult were circumciſed upon their own faith (which is but begg'd too) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Infants were circumciſed upon the faith of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All that the Scripture mentions to be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at Age, are, 1. Thoſe that were <hi>at years</hi> at its firſt Inſtitution. 2. The <hi>Proſelytes</hi> that were made from time to time. 3. The Jews in <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s time circumciſed after 40 years diſcontinuance of it in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as to the firſt, We find no other qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required, to entitle them to Circumciſion, but to be <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed; nor any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, that Belief was a condition <hi>ſine qua non;</hi> nor any excluded for want of it. Yea <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was Circumciſed though not in the Covenant, when 13 years of age, for God ſaid, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. <hi>My Covenant will I eſtabliſh with</hi> Iſaac; which phraſe is brought
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108740:110"/>
by an <hi>Antitheſis</hi> to <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> excluding him, though born of <hi>Abrahams</hi> body: and we find the numerous Family of <hi>Abraham</hi> circumciſed immediately, without any examination of their Faith. And whether Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> or the <hi>Scripture</hi> be to be the ſooner believed, is eaſie to be determined.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Proſelites,</hi> he ſays he remembers not any particular inſtance of any ſuch that were circumciſed; but concludes <hi>ſome were Circumciſed, and that as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, becauſe they kept the Paſſeover to the Lord, Exod.</hi> 12.48. which indeed proves that ſtrangers, when Circumciſed, may keep the Paſſeover; but not any thing to his purpoſe. For if all that kept the Paſſeover be Believers, how come the Jews that kept (and do ſtill keep) it, to be rejected by Chriſts Law for their Unbelief? Or is the Faith he pleads they had, ſome other Faith, not ſufficient in <hi>Goſpel</hi>-dayes? if ſo, then that Faith that's inſufficient for their admiſſion to Chriſt, is not ſufficient to intitle them to Goſpel-<hi>Ordinances</hi> ordained by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But what do's Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> think of the 10 <hi>Tribes</hi> in <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>'s dayes, when they fell to Idolatry, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the <hi>Calves</hi> for 200 Years? Were there no <hi>Proſelytes</hi> all that time? if ſo, were they (when Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed) conſidered as <hi>Believers?</hi> Or were the <hi>Sechemites</hi> (after the Rape of <hi>Dinah</hi>) Believers when Circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34? Were the Servants bought with money Believers? or thoſe <hi>Proſelytes</hi> the <hi>Phariſes</hi> compaſſed Sea and Land to gain? Chriſt ſays, <hi>they made them two-fold more the Children of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll.</hi> But this is a fine new Toy, and let Mr. <hi>W.</hi> take the credit of its firſt promulgation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe that were Circumciſed in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time, 5 <hi>chap.</hi> of whoſe Faith we find no Enquiry; they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108740:111"/>
were Circumciſed, becauſe God commanded them ſo to be, and if they were to be excluded upon the want of Faith, 'tis certain that among ſuch a multitude, there were many Unbelievers. We read of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> in the 7 <hi>chap.</hi> that was ſtoned, and the 36. that were ſmitten at <hi>Ai</hi> for the accurſed thing, though Circumciſed a little before; and numbers of them fell in Rebellion againſt the Lord afterwards. So that upon the whole, the Scripture tells us of no qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that intitled to Circumciſion, ſave to be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Jew, or ſuch as were Proſelyted, or bought with money: And to invent others is point blank arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</p>
                  <p>So that our concluſion is firm, <hi>viz.</hi> that to be the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seed of a Jew, or bought with his money, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to qualifie for Circumciſion; no profeſſion of Faith being pre-required of either, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12. <hi>And he that is eight dayes old ſhall be Circumciſed, &amp;c.</hi> not he that believes, or is a Believers Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what advantage the extravagant round-abouts (in which Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> ſo abounds) has got him, I cannot yet perceive. I am ſure it convinces me that he is in extream poverty of argument, when he is forced to have recourſe to ſuch Forreign and Remote Projects to uphold his tottering cauſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the trouble he is in about the promiſes made to <hi>Abraham, Whether they belong to the Covenant of works, nature, or grace, or no Covenant at all,</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thus; <hi>If our Author will help us out here, he ſhall have hearty thanks for his pains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I ſay, that I doubt Mr. <hi>W.</hi> diſſembles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregiouſly, for I cannot conjecture how he can be ſo ignorant. But the perplexity he involves himſelf in, is a needleſs impertinent one; and whoever goes to

And I can aſſure him, that if there be any eſcape or undue reflection in what I have offered, which may tend to the breach of Peace or Charity, I allow not my ſelf in it, and will be willing to receive an admonition if of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in meekneſs.</p>
                  <p>I would further advertiſe Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> not to make Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> his pattern in dealing with us, whoſe pens run at ſo licentious a rate, that the moſt unſpotted innocence is not armor enough againſt their virulence. As for the firſt, no pencil can pourtray him better than his <hi>own pen:</hi> A man of quarrel, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times friend, and ſometimes foe, to moſt perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to reject whoſe poyſon is to provoke his ſting; And to ſlight his Dictates, how incongruous ſoever to truth, and inconſiſtent among themſelves, is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the ſevere Diſcilpine of his laſhing pen. Man-kind (it ſeems) muſt gape for his Oraculous Dictates, and muſt believe him as his preſent Sentiments actuate him, or elſe take what comes after.</p>
                  <p>Nor need we expreſs Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> in a more averting Character than that he ſquires <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Figuring and Traducing us in his invective reflections upon the perſon of Collonel <hi>Danvers,</hi> as if we had been ſuch dangerous perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in theſe phraſes, — <hi>When
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108740:113"/>
their hands are tyed from fighting, — Exploits done in the time of his Collonelſhip,— &amp;c.</hi> And what is that but to exaſperate the world againſt us, and expoſe us to the frowns of Authority as much as he can? how does this poyſonous inſinuation conſiſt with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of reſpect? This looks like <hi>Juda</hi>'s kiſs. Would he think it fair if we ſhould uſe the engine of Repercuſſion here? doth it not rather (in his own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory) diſcover the ebullition of a temporizing, waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſpirit? <hi>But he loves us Brethren, and deſires not our ſhame.</hi>] He is as courteous as lightning, that ſpares the Scabbard, but deſtroys the blade. After he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented us as ſuch miſhapen <hi>Bug bears,</hi> and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us with his keeneſt Railery, he would lick over the place he bit, and make us believe it is all ſtark love and kindneſs. Well, he hath ſhot his Bolt, tells us, <hi>our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ominous, not fit for any Age of the Church, with</hi> a fixation of <hi>black characters upon it, leading to blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and immorality;</hi> and yet all this, is not to deſire our ſhame. He may by the ſame artifice knock a man down, and laugh upon him, and tell him, he does him good ſervice. He muſt pardon us if we be coy, to ſo rude a kind of Courtſhip.</p>
                  <p>Therefore upon the whole, if Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres in that Intemperate angry frame he began withall, in Imitation of the other two, I ſhall not think my ſelf obliged to divert my ſelf from more grateful ſtudies to vye tongue with him; knowing that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſays, or what hard meaſure he may give me, Truth will remain always anſwerleſs and unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                  <p>IT is now humbly ſubmitted to thine impartial judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Whether our practice of Baptizing Believers ſo fully made out by the Scriptures, the Suffrage of Learned men in every Age of the Church ſince Chriſt, owned by our Severeſt Adverſaries to be a Scriptural Baptiſm, exemplified by the practice of all Antiquity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſuch ſharp Rebukes as our preſent Opponents diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to us? And whether that cauſe we maintain, though under ſo ſacred a Patronage, deſerves to be ſo perſecuted, as it is by them, and delineated in ſuch frightful Characters? ſince on all ſides the baptizing of the Adult is granted? but Infant-baptiſm by one ſide only, and upon ſuch uncertain grounds too, every diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or denomination of Paedo-baptiſts, adminiſtring it upon a different pretence, ſome upon a miſtake, that it <hi>takes away ſin,</hi> and ſaves the Child's Soul; ſome affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Infant <hi>to have Faith;</hi> ſome upon the <hi>Parents,</hi> ſome upon the <hi>Pro-parents,</hi> or <hi>Goſſip's,</hi> ſome upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's,</hi> ſome upon the <hi>Churches</hi> Faith: a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſound! whilſt oppoſed on the other ſide with ſuch a dint of Reaſon both from Scripture-Authority, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108740:114"/>And ſuppoſe you had been called to decide a matter in controverſie betwixt two, and find that what one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms is granted on both ſides, but what the other main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains granted by one only, and rationally oppoſed by the other, would you not judge his cauſe beſt, and moſt ſafe, that's allowed by both? And ſuch is our preſent caſe. A <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England</hi> demanded of the Proteſtant <hi>Prelates,</hi> whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a true Church, and if Salvation may be had in it? They anſwered in the affirmative. The <hi>Queen</hi> replies, that ſince both ſides grant, there may be Salvation in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and but one only, that there may be Salvation obtainable in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> therefore it was the ſafeſt way to remain on that <hi>ſide</hi> that both agreed Salvation may be had in. And though we plead not for the inference as then applyed, yet it holds well in other caſes. For if one ſhould ask, whether Adult or Infant-baptiſm be a true Scriptural Baptiſm? both ſides are agreed that Adult baptiſm is ſo, and one ſide only holds Infants baptiſm to be lawful. May not the Queriſt ſafely and certainly conclude, that ſide that hath the ſuffrage of both to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. And therefore we hope upon a ſerious weighing this Conſideration, we may have the Juſtice and Equity of an open Ear, from any denomination of the Chriſtian Religion; and that underſtanding the reaſon of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious diſſent from the practice of Infant-baptiſm, they would not condemn us for affirming what the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly makes out, the ſuffrage of Antiquity ratifies, and they themſelves own. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

                  <p>STanders by ſee more than <hi>Gameſters;</hi> and the preſent <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>paſſion</hi> you are in, in your Conteſt with Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>'s hath occaſioned theſe cooling <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> and if they may prevail to bring you to your ſelf, I have my end. It's true you, have added in the end of your Book, <hi>A perſwaſive to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and to ſay the truth, you have done excellent well, and have uſed many <hi>Powerful</hi> and <hi>Cogent</hi> Arguments to prevail with Chriſtians to love one another; yea, and you have given us your Opinion of Mr <hi>Danver</hi>'s, that he may be a good man; and that you have a very charitable Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> But to ſee you ſpoil all again by your frequent ſcurrilous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and dirt you caſt upon them in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of your Book, as if you would tell the World, that you did not intend any
<pb facs="tcp:108740:115"/>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> with them, or mean as you ſay: But either to keep up an intereſt in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome of them, or to quit your ſelf from the Odium of a down-right Railer; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you firſt <hi>break</hi> their head, and then give them a <hi>plaiſter:</hi> But do you think they are all Spirit and not Fleſh, that you thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them, and ſtir up the remains of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in them; Did you really intend as You ſay, to be at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> with them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to the truth, from which you ſuppoſe they have erred, you would have uſed more moderation. And had you wrote a Letter to Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> in a Brotherly way, and ſhewed him his miſtakes in ſome of his Collections, and deſired an amicable treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how likely would it have been to have produced an <hi>acknowledgment,</hi> and if occaſion had been, a <hi>retractation.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> has little reaſon to think that you intended his Conviction (as a Brother,) but to defame his perſon, and to diſgrace the whole party, and that you ſought Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory more than Truth, ſo the courſe you take may increaſe the Malady, never heal it; exaſperate, but never unite diſſenters: I could wiſh your diſcourſe of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> had been printed by it ſelf, it might then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have done ſome good, but as joyned to
<pb facs="tcp:108740:115"/>
your Book, it is a plain contradiction, and not like to produce any advantage, unleſs to diſcover your Hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>The character that is given of You (by them that know you) is, that you are a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>a friendly Nature, debonair and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> to all, given to <hi>loquacity,</hi> and rather inclin'd to <hi>levity</hi> than <hi>moroſity;</hi> ſo that the Gall and Wormwood in your Book, breeds ſtrange admirations in ſome, and makes them doubt whether it be yours or no. I have heard of a man that beholding a Cat, ſaid, <hi>It's pitty ſo much Cruelty ſhould lodge under ſo mild a countenance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But perhaps You'll tell us, there was need of a ſharp reproof, and you thought that the beſt way to convince him; if it were your end (which is much doubted) it has not, nor is it likely to be very ſuccesful. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has been thundring againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> theſe twenty Years, (as of late your ſelf and Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi>) with the greateſt ſeverity, rage, and fury imaginable, loading them with many falſe and unjuſt cenſures, as the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> uſed the Chriſtian, the <hi>Papiſt</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, they</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And the name <hi>Heretick</hi> paſſes for Orthodox amongſt you all, but if you did really intend Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his conviction,
<pb facs="tcp:108740:116"/>
and the good of his Soul; then learn ſome Directions from a late Learned <hi>Author</hi> (one of your own party.)</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Saith he, <hi>He that reproves another, muſt be careful that himſelf be faultleſs and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as much as may be;</hi> The Snuffers of the Sanctuary were of pure Gold: <hi>and it behoves that man that will be a Snuffer to correct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be very upright himſelf, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in all things; and then he may admoniſh with the greater Authority and Advantage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A man muſt be blameleſs in reference to that ſin he reproves eſpecially, elſe in healing his Brother, he doth ſtab himſelf; if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveſt Hereſie, Pride, Prevarication in others, and art guilty thy ſelf, thou doſt but like</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>in</hi> Nathan's <hi>Parable, pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of thine own Condemnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>As he muſt take heed himſelf to be fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſo he muſt be ſure his Brother be faulty, for otherwiſe it is not to reprove him, but to reproach him; and inſtead of doing a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty, he commits a Deviliſh Sin, and becomes an Accuſer of the Brethren, inſtead of a reprover of them; ſo that the fault muſt not be a conjecture, or imagination, or jealouſie, or rumor,</hi> [and then how Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will clear himſelf, I know not.] But Sir, If your Brothers fault muſt not be a conjecture or
<pb facs="tcp:108740:116"/>
imagination only, how can you and your party ſo reprove the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Error, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo majeſtically condemn the whole party, and proudly trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all their Arguments, (as if the Word of God had come to you only,) and that there was nothing (as you uſe to ſay) in all their aſſertions; and that all their <hi>Mediums</hi> are ſuch trite and out-worn things that have been trampled upon, and confuted again and again. It ſeems there are others beſides the <hi>Pope</hi> that ſit in <hi>Peters Chair,</hi> &amp; would tell the World they are as infallible as he. But you muſt give us better proof of your <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> before we believe you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> miſtaken in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and aſſertions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>He that reproves muſt be ſincere in his ends, and take heed that his aims and intentions be right and honeſt, and that he do not mingle any wild-fire of Pride and vain-glory, and of an ambitious Humor of contradicting and controlling others. This heat muſt be holy heat, a fire of the Sanctuary purely, for Gods Glory, and the Salvation of thy Brothers Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>He muſt reprove Compaſſionately, with the deepeſt ſenſe of his own failings and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages.</hi> Bernard <hi>ſaid of himſelf, That he
<pb facs="tcp:108740:117"/>
never ſaw another man ſin, but he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful, and jealous of his own Heart, ille heri, tu hodie, &amp; ego cras; he was faulty yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, thou to day, and I may be ſo to morrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He muſt reprove Charitably, with the greateſt love to mens perſons, even then when he ſhews the greateſt zeal againſt their ſins, for it is one thing to be angry with the <hi>Sins,</hi> another with the <hi>Perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore we ſhould conſult our Brothers credit, and eſteem, and honor, while we ſtab his ſin, and not in healing a wound in his Conſcience or Converſation, to leave a ſcar of reproach upon his perſon, and a brand of ſhame and ignominy upon his Name; that were to do the work of an Enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Vizard of a Friend.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>He muſt reprove meekly, not in rage, paſſion, and bitterneſs, but in meekneſs and ſweetneſs of Spirit; This is the Apoſtles rule, Gal.</hi> 6.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. Take heed of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your <hi>teeth in your tongues,</hi> take ſoft Words to convince Gain-ſayers, and gentle reproofs, and ſolid Reaſons to reduce Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders. But whether Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> has at all conſulted theſe Rules, (or Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> before him, and Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> ſince,) or whether there has been any thing of tenderneſs to their Opponents names and perſons, any
<pb facs="tcp:108740:117"/>
thing of compaſſion, charity, meekneſs, whether any ſerious examination of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute certainty and verity of their own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, leſt themſelves ſhould be miſtaken (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confeſſes it is eaſie for Wiſe and Good men to be miſtaken in it, the point is ſo dark and dubious) or whether they have enquired into the ſincerity of their ends, whether their heat has been an holy heat, &amp; purely for Gods Glory, and the Salvation of their Brothers Soul: all this is now left at the Bar of the Readers Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will ſhortly be brought before a greater and more impartial Tribunal. And truly Sir, I muſt tell you, that your dirty Language, your extream ſlighting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning your Opponents, loading them with Scandals and Reproaches, ſometimes char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them with ignorance and inſufficiency; proudly and vainly boaſting, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over them in your own conceit, has (not a little) ſpoil'd your cauſe, and given the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts a great advantage againſt you in the Conſciences of ſober and pious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. I have heard my ſelf ſome perſons of Quality and Piety to ſay, alas what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there between Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> their Books! the later is ſtuffed with ride, rage, and paſſion, the firſt
<pb facs="tcp:108740:118"/>
with meekneſs, tenderneſs, and humility.</p>
                  <p>And I ſuppoſe were the Books ſearcht that have been Written of late Years on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter, Sydenham, Cragg, Wills,</hi> and <hi>Whiſton, &amp;c.</hi> on the one part, and Mr. <hi>Tombes, Blackwood, Byfield, Den, Danvers, Patient, Norcot, &amp;c.</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, it would ſeem to be diſcovered by what Spirit they Wrote; and men would ſee in the firſt party a proud, magiſterial, ſcurrilous, abuſive, and ſcornful Spirit; in the other a more humble, gracious, meek, and charitable temper. If any Queſtion it, the Books are Extant, and the matter may ſoon be brought to an iſſue; but Sir, you have out-done them all, not only in ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your invenomed Arrows againſt the whole party, but eſpecially againſt Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> as appears by your <hi>Appeal</hi> to the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> Churches againſt him; it ſeems you have arraigned, condemned, and executed him already, and have ſaid implicitely (though audaciouſly) as <hi>Paul</hi> to the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. for though I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Body, yet have judged him alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that that he be delivered to Satan.</p>
                  <p>But ſtay a while Sir, and give Wiſer men leave to ſearch out the matter; Will nothing ſerve your turn but preſent Repentance, or
<pb facs="tcp:108740:118"/>
Excommunication? What Scripture-rule have you taken to <hi>convince</hi> him? or muſt he <hi>Repent</hi> before any <hi>Conviction</hi> hath paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? Surely <hi>Illumination</hi> is the firſt work, and the ſame Organ, that is for <hi>Wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> is for <hi>Seeing;</hi> but a man muſt ſee firſt, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. <hi>They ſhall look, and then mourn.</hi> But Sir, there are as Wiſe men as your ſelf, (and none of his party neither,) that judge that what Mr. <hi>Danver</hi>'s has Writ, was in the ſimplicity and ſincerity of his heart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his knowledg, and as he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the meaning of thoſe Ancients he has quoted, and that he had no intention to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate (as you charge him with) or abuſe the Fathers, to patronize his Opinion. If o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, you may think him, <hi>non compos mentis,</hi> conſidering he could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the prejudice and ſedulity of the <hi>Opponents,</hi> who might have advantage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt him, from the <hi>Libraries</hi> in the Univerſities, and elſe-where. It's true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome of his Friends wiſh he had not concerned himſelf with the Arguments from the Fathers, they ſay, they can ſpare it you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well; &amp; are content with Father <hi>Paul,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Scripture-<hi>Fathers;</hi> what can be drawn from the three Firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> is rather for than againſt
<pb facs="tcp:108740:119"/>
them. And in regard the myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity began to work in the Apoſtles dayes, and the Apoſtacy ſoon came on, they do not value the following Centuries, though others think the moſt part of his Collections juſtifiable, were the matter brought before impartial and indifferent Judges. And though you have ſo concerned your ſelf, and ſerued your Wits to maintain Infant-Baptiſm, and ſome of you, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whiſton, &amp;c.</hi> by ſuch ſtrange abſurdities, and ridiculous <hi>Mediums,</hi> altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Fathers, yet wiſe men judge, you have been all this while bringing Brick and Mortar towards the repairing of <hi>Babel,</hi> which elſe perhaps would have fallen long ſince; for they do not think, that the more immediate Miniſters and Factors for <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> would have been able to have brought a ſtone at this day, had not you and others ſtept in, and took the <hi>Anti-chriſtian</hi> party by the hand, and ſaid, <hi>Be ſtrong;</hi> and in this matter, have ſay'd as the Adverſaries of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin, Ezra</hi> 4.2. <hi>Let us build with you, for we ſeek your God, as ye do;</hi> ſo we Baptize Infants as ye do, and though we differ in ſome Circumſtances, touching the ground of their Baptiſm, yet we all agree in the ſubject, and ſo you have proved the
<pb facs="tcp:108740:119"/>
